Short Short Story. Micro Fiction. 500 words or less. That's all you get.<br /><br />You probably saw it coming after I granted you more words in the last contest. <br /><br />But don't worry. Just because it's short doesn't mean you need less time writing it. <br /><br />Wikipedia says that 'flash fiction often contains the classic story elements: protagonist, conflict, obstacles or complications, and resolution.' No idea how you are going to fit all this into the word count but I like to see you try. And there's still the word 'often'. So please be as unconventional as you need to be.<br />It adds that 'the limited word length often forces some of these elements to remain unwritten – that is, hinted at or implied in the written storyline. ' Which sounds quite intriguing and like a very good exercise in writing. This of course leaves the story open to a lot of different interpretations, which makes flash fiction so interesting.<br /><br />For those of you who need a theme to get the creative juices flowing: Secrets<br /><br /> <p><i>All content originally appeared on the Fantasy Faction Forums in the Monthly Writing Contest.

The wizard tossed his tangled beard over one shoulder and knelt, glanced up at the prince, then smiled down at their fallen comrade. "Didn't I tell you to stay behind the elves, Prosper? We hired you for your light fingers, not your sword."</p><p>Prosper grimaced, showing cracked and bloodied teeth. "I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm letting you all down."</p><p>"Not at all!"</p><p>"Yes, you are," broke in the prince. "This charlatan is too cowardly to say it, but we desperately need the Bane. And you lost it for us."</p><p>"This is not worthy of you," growled the wizard.</p><p>"The gnome can die on his own time. I need to know what happened to Pelnar's Bane. Tell me now, thief, before it's too late." The prince's bleak expression echoed the blasted landscape, where the wreckage of goblins, elves and men was piled around the walls of the ruined castle. "This was just a fraction of the Enemy's strength and already ours is spent."</p><p>Prosper shivered with pain. "I'm sorry. I wish I knew. Truly, your great gem wasn't in the throne room. I found your father's... skeleton after I snuck in, and he was holding a great sword, just as you predicted. But the Bane wasn't on the pommel."</p><p>"That cannot be all. It cannot." </p><p>"It wasn't there."</p><p>The prince gave a strangled oath, and shook the gnome by his bloody shirt. "You're lying, thief! What are you hiding?"</p><p>"Get hold of yourself!" The wizard pushed the prince away, who half-drew his blade, but then spat in anger. He stood and glared down at them. "I am sorry, Prosper. No death is a good one, but I do not envy you yours." </p><p>The wizard watched the prince stalk away, then produced a flask from his sleeve. "This will ease the pain, lad."</p><p>"Magic?"</p><p>"Only the kind that comes from twenty years in a barrel." For a time, they drank in silence. "Empty, you say?"</p><p>"My cup?" The gnome was still joking, even with more blood on the rock beneath him than in his own body.</p><p>"The throne room. You saw nothing else?"</p><p>"I saw," whispered the gnome. There was sadness and accusation in his eyes. "Footprints in the dust. Boots, with a jagged crack in the left heel." </p><p>The wizard winced and sat back on his haunches. "Why didn't you tell the prince, then?" he asked. "He was listening, for a change."</p><p>The gnome laughed, then coughed red flecks. "Is it possible to have a friend, to love a friend, even if he isn't as you thought he was?"</p><p>"A good question. One for the philosophers you love to read."</p><p>The wizard watched until death took his friend and sealed his lips.&#160; He took Pelnar's Bane from his robe and stared into its eerie depths. Ah, Prosper, he thought. My dark master will be pleased with this day, even if a washed-up, sold-out old wizard has very great regrets.</p><p></p><h1 id="story2">Little Elizabeth</h1><h2>By donalddallan</h2><p><div style="text-align: left;">Little Elizabeth clamped a hand over her mouth to smother her burst of laughter. In her other hand the flashlight bounced lighting up her nightgown and the book she had propped up on her bent knees. The duvet that covered her on her bed hid all evidence from parental eyes that she was breaking the rules and staying up well past her bedtime. This thought was what drew the giggle from her. She loved breaking the rules and loved staying up late to read under the covers.</p><p>Her mother was getting better at stopping her but she was getting better at recognising when her mother was going to try and catch her nightly reading. Today she had rigged up a rather complex mechanism that would ring a tiny bell hidden between her nightstand and her mammoth Queen-sized bed. A bed for which a little girl of ten years of age could turn into a tableau of amazing adventures.</p><p>Under the covers she had travelled the seas as the captain of a pirate ship, she had explored strange alien worlds, and fought dragons and won. But best of all was the escape to the worlds found written on plain paper and bound with exciting and wonderful covers. She wished she could escape forever to these worlds. She wished it with everything she had.</p><p><em>Ding-a-ling!</em></p><p>The little bell beside her bed tinkled and she gasped and shut off the flashlight, stowed it expertly beneath her pillow and collapsed flat in bed. With a tug she lowered the duvet to expose her face to the cool night air and she listened carefully for her door to open. She strained her ears but heard nothing from the door. She cracked one eye open but with the light of her flashlight still sparkling in her eyes she could see nothing. She screwed her eye shut and stopped her breathing and listened again. </p><p><em>Ding-a-ling!</em></p><p>She gave a small cry as the bell rang yet again. She sat up in bed and reached under her pillow and pulled the flashlight free. She snapped it on and turned the beam of light to her door. It stood closed. She followed the line of string along its tracks until she had to lean over the edge of her bed to shine the light on the bell. </p><p>Elizabeth blinked. There grasping the string and with its feet on the bell was a little figure no bigger than a moth. It was a little person wearing a tight green dress and wearing a little strange cap. Behind her was a blur of moving wings and the little person smiled up at Elizabeth.</p><p>With a blur of motion the little person swooped up into the air, trailing glittering dust, and spun all around Elizabeth faster and faster. The room lit up with a bright flash. </p><p>The flashlight landed on the empty bed with a muffled thump and the duvet slowly sank to close the empty spot where Elizabeth once lay.<br /></div></p><h1 id="story3">Tears</h1><h2>By TOMunro</h2><p>&#8220;Did you realise you were going to die today?&#8221;</p><p>Seorcha stood very still blinking the rain out of her eyes.&#160; She wasn&#8217;t dead yet and the swordsman seemed in the mood for conversation.&#160; Keep him talking, that&#8217;s what her father would have said.&#160; Words would not come though.&#160; She swallowed. Her skin pricked against the tip of the blade he held to her throat with such still precision.&#160; The sergeant on the ground offered no inspiration.&#160; Fixed eyes stared up at her in a last apology from a blood flecked face. It might not even have been his blood but, like all the guards, he was past such sanguine cares.</p><p>&#8220;When your maids picked out that fine gown for you, did they know it would be your shroud?&#8221;</p><p>She forced herself to look at him then. The cowl shadowed half his face, pale skin and a flat mouth all that could be seen of her assassin&#8217;s face. </p><p>&#8220;What, no last words, Princess? No final message to draw tears from your father&#8217;s granite visage?&#8221;</p><p>&#160;She was trembling, eyes full, her voice a whisper as she forced out a single syllable.&#160; &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Karina.&#8221;</p><p>His mouth hardened at her blank expression, his fingers clasped white knuckled around the sword hilt.&#160; &#8220;Karina!&#8221; He repeated leaning in.&#160; She could not help but step back. He followed blade first. She felt it puncture her skin, a tiny scratch next the wounds of the slain around them, but still enough blood to trickle down and pool in the hollow of her throat.</p><p>The injury stunned them both. Words poured from her.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t know of whom you speak.&#8221; </p><p>His sword trembled.&#160; His other hand swept back the hood.&#160; A shock of dark hair hung across an ordinary face, grey eyes as damp as her own.&#160; &#8220;Your father doubtless barely read the name on the warrant.&#160; All Karina did was try and stop a tax collector from battering an old man.&#160; Was that a crime to die for?&#8221; Anguish clouded his face.</p><p>&#8220;Is that why you&#8217;re going to kill me?&#8221;&#160; The deadpan words defied her frantic heart.</p><p>&#8220;There is no other way to hurt him.&#160; To hurt him as he hurt me.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You loved her? This Karina?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;This is not how I was, not who I was, not while I was with her.&#160; She saved me.&#160; She made me better than I thought I could ever be. Your father took her from me and he will see what a monster I am, what a monster Karina kept from all of you.&#8221;&#160; He glanced at the fallen, lying in careless tangles of limbs around the royal coach. &#8220;Be grateful, princess, that I grant you a more merciful ending than he gave her.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;&#160; She shut her eyes.&#160; The wait for death was an eternity itself.&#160; Would he never strike?&#160; </p><p>There was a sob, a rush of wind beside her, and then nothing.&#160; She opened her eyes.&#160; She was alone with the dead. And still it rained.&#160; <br /></p><h1 id="story4">New Girl</h1><h2>By Lejays17</h2><p>&#8220;Psst!&#160; Check out the new girl.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;What new girl?&#160; I&#8217;ve been out for a bit and haven&#8217;t seen anyone new.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Pink-and-Grey Stone face with wings, over by the table.&#160; She arrived the other day, I heard round the place she&#8217;s from the same school as Little Miss Unrequited Love, but they weren&#8217;t there at the same time.&#160; Leastways, they don&#8217;t seem to know each other.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;She&#8217;s looking a bit sad.&#160; Should we go talk to her?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Why not?&#160; It&#8217;s nice to chat to someone new.&#160; Oh, too late, Manic Pixie Dream Girl is heading her way, teapot in hand.&#160; Hope she likes tea.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Ah, we won&#8217;t find out about that now.&#160; Stone girl&#8217;s been distracted by the cutesy-overload of Crunchy Granola Girl and Broody Nature Guy pretending that they aren&#8217;t dating.&#160; They couldn&#8217;t be more obvious about trying to hide it, really.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;At least they are actually dating, not like Perky Purple Goth Girl and Cute but Nerdy Boy.&#160; I just want to lock the two of them up together until they actually talk to each other about it!&#160; It&#8217;s exhausting watching them tiptoe around each other.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Speaking of exhausting things, Princess Pink-and-Fearless is organising the rest of the class to jump off the highest tower for fun next weekend!&#160; She&#8217;s so determined not to miss out on anything before her destined Big Sleep.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Look over there!&#160; I can&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s fallen asleep in the middle of the room, she really can fall asleep anywhere, can&#8217;t she?&#160; If the new girl doesn&#8217;t look out, she&#8217;s going to trip over her legs.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;And there she goes!&#160; Straight over the legs and into the table.&#160; I think she may have broken something.&#160; That&#8217;s not a good start to the school year for her, although it can only improve from here.&#8221;</p><p>***</p><p>&#8220;Mummy!&#160; Tell Mandy she&#8217;s not allowed to touch my dollies!&#160; She&#8217;s changed them all around, and I think she&#8217;s broken the wing of my new one!&#8221;<br /></p><h1 id="story5">The Hero</h1><h2>By Raptori and Saurus</h2><p>Vicious trolls and evil hordes infest the land, turning our bright and hopeful world into something dark and twisted. The people have lost hope, and even those who still fight against the corruption spend their time bickering and battling amongst themselves. The forces of good are dwindling, but it is time for the tide to turn. It is time for me to step into the fray.</p><p>I will spend my days fighting for good. I have been training, biding my time, learning secrets that have shaped me into greatest hero of them all. I shall not give in to temptation, and I shall walk through the flames and emerge victorious.</p><p>Some might argue that this is not my fight, but I will not be dissuaded from my quest. The fate of the world is at risk.</p><p>Somebody is <em>wrong</em> on the internet.</p><h1 id="story6">Burn it all down</h1><h2>By NightWrite</h2><p>The oil felt slick between her fingers. It twisted and swirled with the dried blood on the floor. What memories hadn't been tarnished by the raid were stained with its slick sheen. What life the fire and smoke hadn't choked out became smothered by its clawing embrace. </p><p>Pain pulsed throughout her body like lightning, each sob wracking her body further. Emotions became quick and raw, laid out bare before the world. She thirsted for blood, for pain, for revenge. She craved it like nothing else.</p><p>Revenge for the family she would have to bury long before their time. Revenge for her youngest children, taken by bandits as they fled. Revenge for the quiet life stolen from them, shattered and buried in the skeletal ruins of their homestead. </p><p>She would reunite with her family; she would have her revenge. No matter how long it took to find them they would feel her pain, and her fury. With a final promise, she turned away from the burnt out ruins. It was a funeral pyre for her old life, and a foretelling omen for the future. They too would burn, by the cold fury of the Silent One she would see them all burn down.</p><h1 id="story7">Space for a Breath</h1><h2>By RussetDivinity</h2><p>In. Out.</p><p>Her breath came quick but steady, chest rising and falling beneath his hand. It was just like the doctor had told them it would be. Nothing would be strange. Nothing would be changed.</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>He could feel her heartbeat under her skin. It was pounding fast, too fast, but her face was calm. Too calm. It was for him, he realized a second later. She didn&#8217;t want him to worry about her. It was too late for that, but he tried to smile so she wouldn&#8217;t be discouraged. He needed her to keep hoping.</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be long now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re at nine centimeters.&#8221; She nodded, head tilted back to look up at the stars. His hand moved slightly, from her chest to her rounded belly, but then back so he could catch her next breath.</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>&#8220;Mom never said how much contractions hurt,&#8221; she said.</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>&#8220;Your mom got to have an epidural,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I understand they make all the difference.&#8221;</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>&#8220;Mom wasn&#8217;t giving birth to the supposed savior, either,&#8221; she said with a grimace. &#8220;I bet that makes a bit of a difference, too.&#8221;</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>He nodded, but he didn&#8217;t say whether he disagreed. He only sat still, resting on hand on her chest, the other on her palm. Her hand had gripped his tightly with each contraction, and he did his best not to show any pain. He wasn&#8217;t the one shoving some promised child out between his legs. If she broke one of the bones in his hand, well, he would just have to live with it.</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>&#8220;We never talked baby names,&#8221; he said suddenly. &#8220;Not since the prophecy, anyway.&#8221; It was rather hard to focus on what to name a child when you knew it was going to save the world and die doing so. &#8220;I&#8217;d suggest Jesus, but I think it&#8217;s been done.&#8221;</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>She laughed then, sudden and sharp and filled with pain. &#8220;Let&#8217;s stick with the original plan. We&#8217;re naming him William, after your dad.&#8221;</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>&#8220;William,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;William Winston.&#8221;</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>She nearly laughed at that. &#8220;William Peter. No child of mine will be called William Winston.&#8221;</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>Another contraction, and she winced, closing her hand tightly around his. &#8220;Hold on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not much longer, and then we&#8217;ll have pastries or something. Those things you liked from Michigan.&#8221; He had just enough time to see her nod, and then</p><p>In.</p><p>Out.</p><p>In.</p><p>Flash.</p><p>In.</p><p>A baby&#8217;s cry.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He drew his hand from his wife&#8217;s still chest and dared to look at the child lying on the floor. The child that would bring about the salvation of the world or its end. The fabled second son of the prophecy.</p><p>What he saw was a little girl.<br /></p><h1 id="story8">Strength</h1><h2>By m3mnoch</h2><p>He crashed through the skins covering the door to the birthing tent. Joachim was out riding, chasing game on the steppes. He smelled of leather and horse. She loved that.</p><p>"They've taken our boy for the test. With how he wrestled me, he will surely be strong," she said, laying on her back.</p><p>Joachim knelt by his wife. He stroked her eyebrow before gripping her hand. Smiling down at her, his eyes overflowed with pride.</p><p>"No one knows the strength of our son better than you, Light of my Stars, for no woman is stronger than you," he whispered.</p><p>She smiled back. There were more miscarriages over the past years than she'd wanted to remember. Some of them had been harder than others, but this was the final one.</p><p>She was dying.</p><p>Something tore with her last push and there was too much blood. As a midwife herself, she knew something was wrong. She would not see the boy grow up and couldn't bear to tell Joachim.</p><p>Her friend and fellow midwife pushed through the flaps and padded over to the couple, wringing her hands.</p><p>"It does not look good, Sheeba," she said, nearly weeping. "From where I was standing, the Great Mother appeared saddened as she handed the babe to Elder Hammn."</p><p>Joachim stiffened. He glanced down at Sheeba and then to the tent opening. She saw something harden in his face. After years, she knew by the way his eyes and jawline were set, he was about to make a poor decision.</p><p>"Joachim, wait," she said, holding his arm with both hands.</p><p>"Do not worry, Light of my Stars. I will return shortly," he said as he pressed his lips to her forehead. He snapped to his feet and was out of the tent.</p><p>"There's too much blood," Sheeba said as she looked over to her friend. They were alone now.</p><p>The midwife hurried to where Sheeba was laying and pulled back a pile of blankets. There was blood. Far too much blood.</p><p>"This is not good, Sheeba."</p><p>The skins parted again and Sheeba's heart leapt to talk to Joachim. She needed to tell him how much he'd meant to her. She needed to tell him that their son would grow big and strong just like him. There were so many things she needed to say.</p><p>It was Elder Hammn.</p><p>"The Great Mother has pronounced that your son is not strong enough to survive the upcoming winter. His heart is weak," the village elder said, his voice heavy with sadness. "He must be cast into the Chasm of Judgement."</p><p>"Oh Joachim," she whispered. She died.</p><p><div align="center">***</div><br />Elder Hammn stood stiff at the edge of the chasm, heartbroken sobs echoing around him. He dropped the child out over the yawning edge into the darkness and cried.</p><p>No one saw the outstretched arm barely snatch the child because it was impossible to climb down beneath the incline.</p><p>"You will be strong," came a whisper, cracked with lost love and newfound fury.<br /></p><h1 id="story9">For Evil to Triumph</h1><h2>By wakarimasen</h2><p>He pulled the child tighter under his cloak, as if it could protect her from the heat. Incandescent motes swirled about them on air maddened by the strength of the fire. For years he had watched mutely alongside the other townsfolk at every Purge; conspirators in their silence as the damned were jabbed into the burning maze. Finally, he had found his voice. Finally a whisper of wounded justice had found its release. That release had condemned him as surely as this child he had tried to save. Now he looked down into wide eyes, wet with terror, and felt a renewed certainty.</p><p>&#8220;Can you conjur with the earth?&#8221; </p><p>The child shook her head, the tears falling free. He clasped her shoulder. Of course she couldn&#8217;t. They were burnt young so they would never grow to learn. Purged as soon as the birds came. It might have been a simple roosting of sparrows or a circling of crows. Something that would delight any child and drive anguish into the heart of every parent.</p><p>&#8220;I can call water.&#8221; The child croaked, barely audible over a crashing maze wall, which threw up a burning constellation. &#8220;But not enough.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It may be this time. It may be.&#8221; He reached into the sickening past. There he found all the years he had watched the others die. He felt the fear in his chest, the sucking black that had kept him from acting. The same fear that had ruled his days. It had made him weak. Unremarkable. Safe. </p><p>He delved deeper. Using the fear, crafting it. No one had seen the birds when he had been young. No one had been looking for them. Ever since, he had hidden. Unwilling to sacrifice himself for another. But that was gone now, like the fear. He unlocked that ignored power and, magnified by years of suppression, it channelled into the child.</p><p>&#8220;Now. Call the water.&#8221;</p><p>Eyes screwed tight, the girl muttered into his tunic. Her conjuring was instant, it would have been a trickle, perhaps a stream but empowered by his years of guilt it became a spiralling torrent, a screaming tumult. It smashed fire into steam and tore the roof from the maze. It was greater than a waterspout born of the fiercest sea under an implacable storm.</p><p>The conjuring chased flames further and further, revealing the charred shell of the maze and the other children&#8217;s corpses. Soon a fine rain spattered all the remains. He unwrapped the cloak. Together they looked up at the crater's rim.</p><p>Horror and hope mixed equally on the faces of the townsfolk lining the edge. The arch-deacon glared down, imperious and vengeful. It would have been a sight to cower any god fearing parishioner but neither man nor child buckled. They were done with fear. Sweeping in behind it was anger.</p><p>&#8220;Again.&#8221; The man said quietly, his eyes fixed above. &#8220;And this time I shall show you how to make blades of ice.&#8221;<br /></p><h1 id="story10">Doctor_Chill</h1><h2>By Doctor_Chill</h2><p><div align="center"><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">Homecoming</span></strong></div></p><p><br />You should not be here, no sir.

The trunk is locked, but another key on the ring throws away that worry.</p><p>What could it be?

Then he sat back on the stool and waited for his opponent to finish doing the same. He was one of the last "traditional" chess players left. In the game of spirit chess this meant a full set of one king, one queen, two rooks and so on.</p><p>The veil that separated him from his opponent dropped revealing the set-up he was playing against. His opponent, a young girl, seventeen years old maybe, flashed him a devious smile. The wrinkles in his forehead deepened. 'On the left side, a traditional play enchanted white staunton, on the right twelve knights, a king, a queen and two sorcerers.' the announcer blared. The moment he saw his opponent's setup he devised a strategy. There was a good reason he was still running in the top tier with a traditional set. His enemy tried to gamble on mobility, she'd try to flank him while picking him off from the distance with sorcery. So he'd have to cut off the movement somehow. He'd have to send the bulk of his army into danger but could take out the sorcerers and queen then by simply running his bishops between the ranks. His mind jumped from one possible scenario to the next, then he made the first move. The girl he was playing against smiled again. Was this a mistake? Her golden armored knights shone bright. Their horses breathed clouds and battered the board.</p><p><br />The knight looked up at the faceless queen piece towering over him. He raised his shield to deflect her incoming blow. His arm bent down and his horse staggered. Blood sprayed across the black and white board. He prayed to his goddess that his demise would be swift. The clouds opened and a lightning bolt fell down upon the queen, destroying her. The knight tried to stopper the bleeding from his broken shoulder, his mail had torn open the flesh there. A shadow fell over him, the emotionless bishop piece came down on him.Forgive me, my king.<br />A voice boomed in the sky<br />Check.</p><p><br />Mancala looked up at the girl to see what her response would be at his aggressive move. She was unphased however and the battle had only just begun. 'Check' the announcer said again. The girl had rushed one of her knights forward to get back at him. Another wink at him to try to throw him off guard. She was unaware of the trap she had just run into. Time for a checkmate.</p><p><br />A blood-covered battlefield, the wails of his dying men, smoke rising from the ruptures in the black and white tiles. The king turned around as the enemies closed in on him. His trembling hands held up the sword. A drop of sweat ran across his cheek. There were too many. Checkmate.<br /></p><h1 id="story12">Daughter</h1><h2>By thelonelypubman</h2><p>They burned in her, trying to force their way through her gut and out her mouth. <em>Sins. Secrets.</em><br />&#8220;Born with a gift.&#8221; he had said.<em> Before he took me to the Holy City</em>. The memories that coursed through her blood shrivelled her heart into a cold, dead thing. &#8220;Eat it. Please.&#8221; The woman had said, shying from the bowl, its contents like poison. &#8220;You know what he&#8217;ll. . .&#8221; Syrah silenced her with a look and placed the skin into her mouth. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;<br />Agony filled her. Doubled over, cramping, her breath escaped completely. Pressure built inside her until it became unbearable, images flashing through her minds eye: <em>stumbling to his daughters room, drunk and drunk with lust. Angry fists beating down his wife because she dared speak out of turn, or because he felt like it. Hooking friends and enemies alike with barbed insults, then laughing it off. Hot eyes on his. . .</em></p><p>She vomited black bile on to the floor, breathing in ragged gasps. Her eyes held the question: <em>why would you absolve him of all this?</em> The woman rose, slinging the antique rifle over her shoulder, mask in hand. <br />&#8220;I have faith.&#8221; She knelt before the shadows gathered beyond the door, and fled.</p><p>Syrah had listened to the sounds of the night, then. Candlelight casting flickering shapes about the room. Maniac laughter arose outside The Citadel walls; sobbing; a terrified shriek. The Holy Man watched her, just out of sight, coins catching the light as they walked up and down his knuckles.<br />"Quite a gift."<br />He faded into the darkness.<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;~<br />Hundreds of the devoted made the pilgrimage. The dust turned emaciated flesh the colour of rust. Bug-like breather masks sat atop hunched, withered shoulders. So many insect eyes stared up at her. The slight intake of breath from Bishop Artez the only sound behind the shield. Syrah raised her arm above her shoulder, palm facing outward. Countless stick-armed faithful did the same.<em> As if I am the daughter of god</em>.</p><p>&#160;&#8220;When will you release my fa-&#8221; The Bishop stood, shouting for Skinners. The crowd below turned a seething mass of bodies, each trying to flee from the one who had died. Cries and wailing from Outside sent a trickle of fear down her spine. <em>They call one of their own</em>.</p><p>&#8220;I will not eat.&#8221; Her chin raised in defiance. A flick of his wrist and screams rose from a closed doorway, her name torn from her Mothers throat. Over and over, but not as Syrah remembered it.<br />She ate.<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;~<br />The fall was not far enough to kill her. The scuttling of dead things hovered at the edge of hearing; rancid, once-human breath caressing her cheek. The Bishop never considered the possibility she would take her own life. Her tears fell to the earth and she stared up at the brilliant night sky, breath failing.<em> I wonder if anyone notices how beautiful the stars are any more?</em></p><h1 id="story13">The Pale Prince</h1><h2>By Saraband</h2><p>&#8220;I think I did well, considering everyone&#8217;s expectations,&#8221; Durkam said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you agree, father?&#8221;</p><p>King Baal was too distracted by the sword piercing his belly to even notice his son&#8217;s question. Smoke, coming from the palace&#8217;s windows, clawed at his nostrils. All around him, the echoes of a city coming together to scream in the horror of its demise filled the grand halls built by his forefathers. </p><p>&#8220;On my way here, I even found the same priest who witnessed my birth,&#8221; Durkam continued. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t the Gods keen on irony? At least the old man was true to his beliefs until the very end. As I drew my bow, he kept repeating the same prophecy from the Axamartis over and over.&#8221;</p><p>King Baal coughed, spitting a mouthful of blood. Finally, his body was reacting appropriately to the situation. <br />&#8220;<em>And when the crowned shepherd turned from the light, he was met with retribution, for the Pale Prince came with his will tempered by the fires of vengeance, and he brought down all the lies built by the hands of Men</em>,&#8221; Baal said, wiping his bloody lips with the back of his hand. &#8220;I should never have allowed the world to suffer you. If it wasn&#8217;t for your mother&#8230;&#8221; He spat another mouthful of blood. &#8220;I would have let the priests drown you, demon.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s comforting to know that this impulse towards kinslaying runs in the family,&#8221; Durkam said, letting out a forced laugh. And while he kept a firm grasp on his sword&#8217;s hilt with one hand, he unwrapped the black turban covering his face with the other.</p><p>Baal had not looked upon his son ever since he disappeared on the night of his seventh spring. He felt an urge to deny that this creature spawned partly from him, but the traces were too evident. Those red eyes were almond-shaped like his mother&#8217;s, and his nose was bent like that of Baal himself. For all the taint that Baal&#8217;s soul carried, his own son was born without any colour himself.</p><p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; King Baal asked. &#8220;Why did you choose to come back?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t my choice,&#8221; Durkam said in a heavier tone. &#8220;I had a prophecy to fulfil, a prophecy that everyone around me kept repeating from the moment I was born.&#8221; He forced another smile. &#8220;But here I am, for one last family reunion.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Baal repeated. &#8220;I still don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the problem, father. You never tried to understand me.&#8221; Durkam let his head fall back, closing his eyes and murmuring something. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter. When I pull this sword, I become king, and then it&#8217;s time for me to settle things with the Gods themselves.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I am sorry, son. So so&#8212; ugh&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>Durkam did not bother to wipe the blade after pulling it out. &#8220;Too late for regrets,&#8221; he said, turning away. &#8220;The Pale Prince has a prophecy to realise. One with dead Gods at the end of it.&#8221;<br /></p><h1 id="story14">You Were Warned</h1><h2>By Elfy</h2><p><strong>One Night ONLY! </p><p>The AMAZING Rojouli!

Her illness was crippling her so much, there was no knowing how long she had left. <br />It made every day more precious, every moment a gift to be cherished. </p><p>The raucous youths never failed to trigger memories of her own younger days, before her marriage, before her years in a lab, inhaling toxic fumes all the way up to a Nobel Prize. </p><p>This train of thought, combined with growing sleepiness, had Hana very little worried when a version of herself, seemingly in her early twenties, appeared by the side of her bed. <br />Yes, what good times, so many possibilities still open then, and &#8211;</p><p>&#8220;Wow. What have you done to yourself?!&#8221; </p><p>The voice brought Hana back to perfect wakefulness. It was foreign and well known. Her very own voice, as could be heard in videos, a past immortalized across youtube accounts and recorded public lectures. </p><p>The young Hana, the exact picture that every mirror had sent back fifty years ago, crept forward with an impressive realism. <br />Was it an effect of the new drugs the nurse had been bringing? She was sure she wasn&#8217;t on morphine, yet she must be hallucinating. And vividly. </p><p>&#8220;Just look at yourself girl. You almost look older than the ruin who spent her forties as a crack-head.&#8221; The woman&#8217;s features distorted with spite. &#8220;What am I going to get off of you? A week?&#8221;</p><p>Hana stared back silently. All her senses screamed that this was everyday normality, yet none of the scene in front of her made sense. Talking back would be like giving in to madness. </p><p>The young woman burst in an eerily familiar chortle. </p><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not dreaming, don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; her eyes trailed to the IV stand, &#8220;nor are you hallucinating. What&#8217;s in there? Hmpf. In pain are we? I&#8217;ll ask again, what have you done with your life to decay so rapidly? We&#8217;re barely 72 dammit, not blowing a hundred candles.&#8221;</p><p>Her hands moved and for the first time Hana noticed the gun-like instrument. Her resolution broke.</p><p>&#8220;Who are you? I&#8217;m a scientist &#8211; time travel is horse-shit, what is this, illegal cloning?!&#8221; <br />The young woman laughed again, candidly this time. </p><p>&#8220;Mere dimension hoping, dear Me.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Dimension? Multiverse-type dimensions?&#8221; </p><p>&#8220;Yes. In my dimension, a genius cookie combined magic to science and permitted wild discoveries, like the tools that allow me to be here. And other things, like this.&#8221; She shook her gun.</p><p>&#8220;What do you want with me?&#8221; Hana fought to stay stoic, to be brave in the face of growing fear.</p><p>&#8220;The same as with all the others. Whatever life you have left,&#8221; was the cold answer. &#8220;While time travel is indeed horse-shit, rejuvenating by interdimensional self murder is very, very much a thing.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You egomaniacal bitch.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Whatever.&#8221; </p><p>A flash exploded, then slowly dimmed around the only Hana left in this dimension. <br /></p><h1 id="story16">The Greatest Victory</h1><h2>By ClintACK</h2><p><div align="center">The Greatest Victory</div><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m too old for this,&#8221; Gregory said amid tangled sheets and limbs.</p><p>&#8220;You seemed spry enough,&#8221; the woman said.&#160; Emma.&#160; A widow, she said.&#160; Once they&#8217;d all said maidens.</p><p>&#8220;I meant the hunting.&#8221;&#160; Her hair smelled earthy, of dye, but she was lean and strong and eager.</p><p>&#8220;Your bruises have bruises,&#8221; Emma said, tracing an old scar.&#160; &#8220;You looked invincible towing the dragon&#8217;s head into town.&#8221;</p><p><em>Basilisk</em>, Gregory thought.</p><p>&#8220;Like to make an impression,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t been paid yet.&#8221;</p><p>Part of his pay was the room &#8211; small, with a low tapered ceiling; a straw pallet on the floor; walls so thin he could hear feet shuffling in the hall.</p><p>To win without fighting was the greatest victory, his father had said.&#160; He was a hunter, not a fighter.&#160; The copper taste of terror, when the basilisk had charged him &#8211; an angry lizard bigger than an ox.&#160; He&#8217;d gotten the spear set in time, just.&#160; He was slowing down.&#160; Experience wouldn&#8217;t make up for that forever.</p><p>He should find a nice widow like Emma, maybe kids.&#160; Hunt rabbits.&#160; She was watching him think.&#160; Was she thinking the same thing?&#160; Was she really even a widow?</p><p>Someone stumbled outside the door.</p><p>&#8220;There was a griffin,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Up in the mountains somewhere.&#160; Eating the sheep.&#8221;</p><p>Her nose wrinkled, she raised an eyebrow.</p><p>&#8220;Killing a griffin &#8211; heck of a thing.&#160; Near as big as your dragon.&#8221;&#160; Basilisk, really.&#160; &#8220;Near as mean.&#160; But it flies.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;How do you fight such a thing?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Shoot the wings.&#160; That&#8217;s the easy part.&#160; Hard part&#8217;s surviving while you shoot.&#8221;&#160; Poisoned arrows.&#160; While it attacked a decoy.&#160; That was a proper hunt.</p><p>&#8220;Rode into town dragging that griffin&#8217;s head.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Quite the hero,&#8221; she said, doing distracting things with her hands.</p><p>&#8220;I like to make an impression,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it doesn&#8217;t last.&#8221;</p><p>The hands stopped, the eyebrow raised again.</p><p>&#8220;Most folks are glad to see the griffin dead.&#160; They&#8217;re thinking of sheep uneaten and shepherds unmauled.&#160; But a few are noticing their women noticing me.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You do make an impression,&#8221; she teased.</p><p>&#8220;So, the following evening, room near as charming as this, with a widow near as feisty.&#8221;</p><p>She pouted, laughed, and started trying to distract him again.</p><p>&#8220;Only, turns out she wasn&#8217;t a widow.&#160; Her husband and his drunk friends came through the door with axes and knives.&#160; There I was stark naked, armed with pillow and blanket.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; she asked, concerned for the first time.</p><p>&#8220;Scuffle.&#160; Shoved one guy into another&#8217;s knife.&#160; One minute, he&#8217;s a mean drunk and I&#8217;m a hero.&#160; The next, he&#8217;s Mary's youngest and I&#8217;m the guy that killed him.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You were defending yourself.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a stranger.&#160; And a strange one at that.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Prove it,&#8221; she said, and Gregory finally let her distract him.</p><p>He almost didn&#8217;t hear the shuffling outside the door when the locals found the better part of valor.</p><p>Still, he saddled up his horse and rode on before the sun came up.&#160; Rumors of a manticore.<br /></p><h1 id="story17">The Mirror of Memories</h1><h2>By D_Bates</h2><p>Mike had a magic mirror, and every morning he would ask it to show him moments from his life.</p><p>Sometimes he'd see childhood years, while playing alone in the corner of a park with his favourite red train while all the other kids had nothing but each other and the merry-go-round.<br />It made him laugh. Those losers probably wished they had a train as cool as his.</p><p>Other days he'd visit teenage years, and see himself chugging down beers in that same park while prank texting Kev, his nerd brother, who was locked away at home studying for his upcoming exams.<br />And he'd laugh. For such a brainiac, Kev had failed miserably to enjoy the best years of his life.</p><p>Throughout his twenties Mike saw many happy moments with his fourth girlfriend, Cathy&#8230; until the day she broke it off after catching him cheating on her with her hot workmate.<br />He smirked. She was such a prude. Done him a favour, really.</p><p>From his thirties he was reminded of many a time waking up past noon after a wicked night of partying into the early hours of the morning; he didn't even remember half the girls lying next to him.<br />He smiled proudly. While his dorky brother Kev and his dumb ex Cathy were starting a boring family together, he was reliving the teenage years all over again. For sure, those were the best years of your life.</p><p>Forty to forty-nine returned plenty of images from seedy bars. He didn't really know any of the other patrons, but who cared when the buzz of the booze was that good. He'd ditched job interviews to watch the game with the lads, but they were pointless jobs anyway.<br />Work was for chumps. He was living free, unlike Kev, imprisoned in his nine to five routine during the days and his wife and kids by night. Family was such a chore.</p><p>Although he'd not long been in his fifties, yesterday, unable to recall the previous week, Mike had asked the mirror for the details and was delighted to witness himself in his living room tripping on L.S.D. He appeared to be having a fantastic time of it, singing, and dancing, and fondling an invisible pair of titties.<br />Meanwhile, Cathy&#8217;s voice was raging from the answerphone in the background for him having missed his stupid nephew's christening. He pursed his lips. She so still wanted him.</p><p>Yup, the magic mirror held many an awesome memory. Today though, Mike felt like something different&#8212;something new&#8212;so he asked it, "Show me my future."</p><p>And as with every other morning, the mirror heard his request and fogged over. His throat dried as he anticipated what wondrous scene the swirling mists would reveal. Yet once it had cleared all he saw was his own reflection staring back, miserable and alone in his plain old bathroom, a lifetime of memories to reflect on, and nothing to show for them.<br /></p><h1 id="story18">The Getaway</h1><h2>By Paul Birbilas</h2><p><strong>The Getaway</strong></p><p>Nero crashed through the car window and Slim hit the gas pedal.

Maybe it was the blood loss making him feel ill. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to own a bar.&#8221; He lamented, probably due to the realization it looked increasingly like that would never happen. </p><p>&#8220;Nero, the Bartender! Hah! That sounds awful.&#8221;&#160; Slim had every right to criticise his dream but it wasn&#8217;t welcome now, not while he was bleeding to death. &#8220;Very well but the agency you stole from will be looking for you. Disappear for one year and when you return you&#8217;ll have a bar to come back to. You have my word.&#8221; Nero looked down at his mangled arm; then into the mirror and saw a few security vehicles still chasing them. It was just an empty promise for a dying man. He nodded drowsily. &#8220;Okay.&#8221; </p><p>&#8220;Good! We&#8217;re coming up to the end.&#8221; Nero struggled to look up. The road ahead was peppered with a few more construction pylons and all that was beyond them were a hundred feet of ramp. Nero couldn&#8217;t believe this was how he was going to die. &#8220;We&#8217;re fucked.&#8221; </p><p>&#8220;Do you trust me?&#8221; asked Slim. </p><p>&#8220;No!&#8221; He screamed in terror.</p><p>Slim grinned wide as the car flew off the ramp into the cold embrace of the night. <br /></p><h1 id="story19">The Bond</h1><h2>By Hedin</h2><p>Beep! Beep! Beep!</p><p>The beeping of the heart monitor greeted Alex as he groggily came to and found himself laying in a hospital bed.&#160; He had no recollection of what put him in his current state, only that his body felt like he&#8217;d been used as a punching bag and his head was buzzing.&#160; Alex was in the midst of making sure everything was present and functioning when a nurse walked in.</p><p>&#8220;W-W-What happened to me?&#8221; he asked her. </p><p>&#8220;You were struck by lightning; you&#8217;re pretty lucky to be alive,&#8221; replied the nurse as she checked his vitals, &#8220;How are you feeling?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Well I feel like I got ran over by a semi and my hea- &#8230;Did you say I got hit by lightning?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Your co-workers said they saw a flash of light followed by an immediate boom. When they looked outside they saw you laying on the ground unconscious.&#160; You don&#8217;t have any burn marks that you typically get from a lightning strike but that&#8217;s the only explanation at this point.&#8221;</p><p>The nurse finished checking his vitals and told him that she would go inform the doctor that he was awake and get him something for his aches.</p><p>After the nurse left Alex laid back into his pillow and started to massage his temples. The rest of his aches seemed pretty minor to the buzzing going on in his head.&#160; <em>Actually,</em> thought Alex, <em>it seems to be more like a hundred people inside my head talking all at once.</em> On a whim Alex decided to try something.</p><p><em>WILL YOU JUST BE QUIET!</em></p><p>Immediately the voices stopped and Alex sighed contentedly at the relief.&#160; Now that he could concentrate he tried to puzzle out what had happened.&#160; But before long the voices started coming back, first as whispers and then gradually growing louder.&#160; Since his previous tactic did not work, Alex decided to go a different route.</p><p><em>Ok, since you apparently can&#8217;t stay quiet can you at least speak one at a time?</em></p><p>Once again everything went quiet.&#160; Alex was starting to believe he was imaging things when he heard the voice of what sounded like a ten year old girl pop up in his head.</p><p>&#8220;Hi!&#8221;</p><p><em>Umm&#8230;hi?&#160; Who or what are you?</em></p><p>&#8220;My name is Nerida. I am a Celitride.&#8221;</p><p><em>Well hello Nerida&#8230;what the hell is a Celitride and what are you seemingly doing inside my head?</em> </p><p>&#8220;We Celitrides are able to grant special abilities to people, provided they can accept our bond.&#8221;</p><p><em>Abilities?&#160; Bond?</em></p><p>&#160;&#8220;Right now we are just latched on instead of fully bonded.&#160; If you are able to bond with a Celitride, and each bonding is unique, they can gift you an ability.&#160; My bonding begins with a tale and after the process is completed I can gift the ability to control water.&#8221;</p><p><em>So you&#8217;re saying I could control water?</em></p><p>&#8220;If the bonding works you will be able.&#160; So Alex,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;would you like to listen to my tale?&#8221;</p><p>Alex hesitated, considering the offer.<br /></p><h1 id="story20">Rukaio_Alter</h1><h2>By Rukaio_Alter</h2><p>This is the scientific journal of Dr Carlton Kellis. I have been tasked to study a mysterious object that fell to Earth two days ago. It landed in a field in Iowa, where it was reported by concerned locals and delivered by package to my lab. The object itself has been nicknamed &#8216;The Sphere&#8217; due in part to its spherical nature and the general unimaginativeness of those handling it. I look forward to studying it.</p><p>Day 1: No visible changes. Have spent the day examining The Sphere. The exterior seems to be made from some reflective material and it has a strange square pattern engraved on the entirety of the surface. Current use is unclear. Ideally I would like to examine it closer, but until the samples return from the lab, direct contact is forbidden.</p><p>Day 2: Still no visible changes. The Sphere is odd. While it has shown no autonomy, it has a strange presence in the room. Every so often, I swear I see some strange shape moving in the squares. This warrants further investigation.</p><p>Day 3: Further investigation has been completed. The strange shape turned out to be my own reflection. Have upped dose of anti-anxiety medication. No other visible changes.</p><p>Day 4: The Sphere is alive. I am certain of this now. I hear it whispering to me when I&#8217;m not looking. It whispers such sweet tales of fear. I feel myself slipping away every second I am in its presence. What horror would send this to us? What do they want? Can they want? Was this a harbinger of their madness? I feel it twisting. It twists us. It twists all things. The Sphere will leave nothing. I will not escape. I can already feel it inside my mind. It is inside me. It was always inside me. And I am inside it. There is nothing but screaming.</p><p>Day 5: Day 4&#8217;s entry disregarded. Have fired intern who tampered with my anti-anxiety medication. No visible changes to the Sphere.</p><p>Day 6: I have cracked the true purpose of the Sphere. It appears to be a star map of some kind. I unlocked its secrets by shining a powerful light at it in a dark room. The stars were then projected on the nearby walls. This could be a tremendous leap in our knowledge of Astronomy if true. We are currently searching for a recognizable focus point to help decipher it.</p><p>Day 7: The study has been called off. Apparently, there was an error at the packaging company the Sphere was delivered by. We were accidentally sent a disco ball that the neighbouring scientific center ordered on Ebay for their annual dance. This error was discovered during the aforementioned dance when the &#8216;Disco Ball&#8217; began bleeping and exclaiming &#8216;ALL HAIL GLARTOK&#8217;. Studies are set to begin tomorrow. The current Sphere is no longer available for study as it was thrown out the window in a pique of fury. Conclusions are enclosed below.

They were a close-knit village, well isolated from the politics of the King, but geographically positioned between the Kingdom and the neighboring empire, while an ocean known to swallow ships and a mountain range prone to avalanches placed them on the only passable route between the two nations. The war between the two had brought battles to their doorstep a dozen times, each one claiming more of his brethren&#8217;s lives. </p><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Sitting now before the hearth, a finger tracing over the dusty cover of the tome in his hands, he thought back to his twentieth name day when he&#8217;d expected to be given the blade that hung locked in a case above the hearth. The blade of the lost, it was called, for it was said that any leader wielding it could never lose, so long as his cause was just, for all those who&#8217;d fought for just causes in the past would lend their strength to it. A thousand years it had been the symbol of hope for his people. He had known the hope it would bring his townspeople during this crisis, but instead his father had given him the massive historical tome, claiming he must appreciate the people who had fought in the past before he could wield such a thing. He&#8217;d tossed the tome at his father&#8217;s feet, leaving through the door with disappointment in his heart.</p><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Word came a year later that his father had fallen ill and passed. He had thought of traveling to retrieve the blade many times in the two years since, but could never bring himself to do so. He had never been close with his father, but he had always believed the man had loved him in his own stoic way.<br />When word came that troops from both Kingdom and Empire were advancing towards them, so many that they&#8217;d undoubtedly be swallowed by the ensuing battle, he knew he had no choice. Even if it sullied his soul, the sword was the only thing that might rally his people enough to somehow hold off both forces. It had seen miracles done before.<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He sighed as he traced his finger over the tome, remembering his father and feeling an intense regret that he they never reconciled.</p><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He opened the cover as a tear fell from the corner of his eye, finding something folded within the first page. One last gift from his father. The key to the blade of the lost.<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br />&#160; &#160; They would hold. <br /></p><h1 id="story22">Coda</h1><h2>By troll</h2><p>Aliens consumed our world.</p><p>It's still there, but not recognizable anymore.

A sharp agony that moved her among the crypts and tombstones as strings move a puppet. The hunt could not be stopped. A sweet, living balm for the pain of partial death was nearby.</p><p>The old grounds had long since fallen into disuse and nature had crept back into this place of memories and death. Bushes and branches and vines all sought to impede her way and interfere with the hunt, but she had become a skilled predator and nimbly wove her way through without a sound.</p><p>This was a good night. The sky was dark with clouds and she needed only worry about being heard.</p><p>She passed a particularly old mausoleum and something made her look up. For a moment she remembered looking up at the severe arches and engraved holy symbols with the clarity of a blue sky, with warmth on her skin and within her veins.</p><p>Was it a memory? Had she ever truly been anything other than this? One of the soft, warm ones that huddled in their houses?</p><p>It didn&#8217;t matter.</p><p>Her prey came into view: A woman in rags making camp by a small tree.</p><p>It took her a few moments to put context to the situation. Context was important, she had come to realize. Some hunts were likelier than others to bring hunters; soft, warm ones made strong by numbers and purpose and the chants of holy men. There was a time when she had tried to forget all about them and their ways for the strange pain and memories it brought. But those feelings were a thing of the past now. The hunger was the only pain that mattered, and context made her a better predator.</p><p>This woman was an outcast. A shamed one, cast out of the place of houses and plentiful prey. No hunters would come because of this one. There was no need to divert the hunger elsewhere.</p><p>She moved with quick, graceful steps and the pain became almost sweet now that it was so close to being sated.</p><p>She pounced upon her prey. Habit made her stifle its scream with her left hand even though no-one was around to interfere. The prey struggled frantically but it was soft and weak, like they all were. She sank her fangs into the soft flesh of the neck and her ears filled with her own satisfied moan as life poured into her.</p><p>It was a fleeting ecstasy. Warmth and sensation flowed through her veins and dulled the pain to almost nothing. For a moment she was alive.</p><p>She stroked the woman&#8217;s hair as its heart slowed and stopped, for reasons she no longer remembered. Then the moment passed, and only the hunger lived. It had retreated from the warmth but never went far.</p><p>Something made her put her arms softly around the dead prey and squeeze. Then she went back.</p><h1 id="story24">Last Regrets</h1><h2>By OnlyOneHighlander</h2><p><br /><div align="center"><strong>Last Regrets</strong></div><br />&#8216;Dead?&#8217;</p><p>&#8216;Dead.&#8217;</p><p>Count Globulus stopped writing. He set down his quill, unhooked his spectacles from behind his drooping, pointed ears and guided his eyes through their cataratic fog to his faithful servant. &#8216;How?&#8217;</p><p>Scrofula&#8217;s arthritic fingers played around the rim of his battered iron helm. What to say?<br />&#8216;It appears,&#8217; Scrofula started. Too quietly. His master could not hear him. He started again. &#8216;It appears he choked on a chicken bone.&#8217;</p><p>&#8216;A chicken bone?&#8217; The Count gave one soft chuckle. It was a private joke, between him and the universe. &#8216;Well, well, well. How about that.</p><p>&#8216;Was it,&#8217; the Count pushed a yellowing finger nail under a stack of cracked papers. He flicked through them. His schemes, his plans, his evil plots, all recorded for posterity. As if it would care, he thought. &#8216;Was it at least an evil chicken bone?&#8217;</p><p>&#8216;Alas no,&#8217; Scrofula said. &#8216;Quite the opposite. I&#8217;ve heard the chicken in question defended its coup against the onslaught of a particularly vicious fox. Mortally wounded, it fought the creature off. This is why the farmer gave it to him, presumably thinking a heroic chicken deserves a heroic stomach to lie in.&#8217;</p><p>&#8216;A heroic chicken. Yes. It would be.&#8217;</p><p>The Count stood. He would do no more writing this night. He walked to the window and listened to the still dark.</p><p>Silence. </p><p>No mobs, no torches, no righteous priest banging on the castle gate. Even the wolves had gone.</p><p>It pained Scrofula to see his master this way. The last few decades had not been kind. To be slain was one thing. But to be forgotten... The life had gone out of him, which, for a vampire, was saying something.</p><p>&#8216;When is the funeral?&#8217;</p><p>&#8216;Two days, Master. Shall I prepare the carriage?&#8217;</p><p>&#8216;No. That will not be necessary. I will go alone this time, if that is alright with you?&#8217;</p><p>&#8216;As you wish, Master.&#8217; Scrofula turned to leave.</p><p>&#8216;Scrofula?&#8217; The Count&#8217;s voice drifted, as if speaking more to himself. In a way, he was. &#8216;Have I been... a good employer?&#8217;</p><p>&#8216;The worst, Master. The absolute worst,&#8217; replied Scrofula.</p><p>&#8216;You are too kind, old friend. It does not suit us.&#8217;</p><p>&#8216;Yes, Master, but it is true.&#8217;</p><p><div align="center">*</div><br />The Count&#8217;s shadow poured into undertaker&#8217;s parlour. He did not want to go to the public service. It would not feel right. That was for the legend. He would pay his respects to the man.</p><p>Time had not been kind to his nemesis. Rolls of fat spilled over the parlour table. The body was large, and yet, small, much smaller than he remembered. Empty.</p><p>The Count put a hand on the chest. Cold. But then maybe that was him. Hard to tell anymore.</p><p>His eyes wandered. There, by the embalming tools, white and weak, the chicken bone. </p><p>The Count took it in his fist and crushed it, letting the dust fall to the ground.</p><p>&#8216;It should have been me,&#8217; he said.

His head and body were aching, his ears ringing with waving shouts and laughs. His eyes were wide, spinning from person to person. He tried to push himself to somewhere safe, but his hands and legs were trembling.</p><p>A man, muscular and scarred, walked towards Bairon and knelt down next to him so that the man lying on his back would hear him over the uproar. &#8220;Deep breaths, boy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can see your anxiety and embarrassment. You feel like everyone is looking at you, pointing their fingers and laughing. You think they are commenting on your situation with their friends. You&#8217;re certain that all their shouts, all their ridicule and pity, are directed towards you.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You... They... The voices...&#8221; Bairon mumbled.</p><p>&#8220;Look at me!&#8221; the scarred man said, arresting Bairon&#8217;s wandering gaze. &#8220;I tell you a little secret, boy: Most of the time people don&#8217;t give a shit about you. They barely even notice you at all. The thing is, they are too busy worrying about what other people think about them to spare any time to really think about you.&#8221;</p><p>Bairon&#8217;s breaths were deepening as he watched and listened the man beside him. But he didn&#8217;t speak, and his hands were still shaking as he ran his fingers through the sand.</p><p>&#8220;I fell. So what? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d normally think if I were in your place, boy. Unfortunately, this is one of those rare situations that doesn&#8217;t fall into the normal category. You see, this time literally everyone is looking at you. They all either ridicule or pity you. They all love or hate me.&#8221; The scarred man raised his sword, and the crowd of the arena burst in cheers and a few boos. &#8220;Hear that, boy? They are chanting &#8216;Champion&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I sti&#8212;&#8221;</p><p>The crowd gasped&#8212;some out of excitement, others out of disgust&#8212;as the scarred man pummeled Bairon&#8217;s face three times with the knuckle guard of his sword.</p><p>&#8220;Only one thing left to do, boy. The crowd is waiting for it with anticipation. They saw me hitting you on the ear with the flat of my blade. They saw how you staggered and lost your sword; how you fell over after I kicked you in the chest. They saw how I punched you when you were defenceless on the ground. Now they want to see me killing you.&#8221;</p><p>The scarred man clutched the grip of his sword with both hands, pointing the blade down to Bairon. The boy raised his head, spewing blood from his mouth. He wasn&#8217;t shaking any longer. &#8220;Wait,&#8221; he whispered.</p><p>The scarred man lowered his weapon and bowed a little closer. &#8220;What is it, boy?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I lost my sword and fell. So what, old man?&#8221; Bairon wheezed. &#8220;I still have my knife.&#8221;</p><p>With a gasp, the crowd went silent. Then it erupted in cheers and boos.</p><p>There was a new champion on the arena.<br /></p></body></html>
