Love resides in Cake and Daggers<br /><br />That earnest face sent a shiver down my spine, rain falling sporadically. Those eyes like drops of mercury, boring into me, unblinking. What was I doing here? <br />&#8220;Adam&#8230; what&#8217;s wrong? Why do you struggle? We are forever together. You made our contract.&#8221; The voice lilted, and the sky roared.<br />She seemed to possess a kind of lustre, her hand reaching out, caressing my face. I shivered, for she was as cold as steel. &#8220;What a beautiful master.&#8221;<br />What had I got myself into?<br /><br />&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;<br /><br />My brother and I had headed down to the lake for some family bonding. We hadn&#8217;t seen each other in a few years, and it was time we caught up. At least, that was what he said. My brother Alex was an archaeologist whose superstitious notions had gained him the very definition of ridicule. To be honest, his superstition&#8217;s probably rubbed off on me to.<br />As we drove toward the lake, I greedily admired the luscious curves of a slice of mud cake as Alex began his rants. This he was also famous for, and he spoke with zeal. <br />He was insistent, ecstatic, that he had found it. The very lake where King Arthur had been given the legendary Excalibur. The home of the so named &#8216;lady of the lake&#8217;. True or not, it looked to be a nice view, and a good vacation. <br /><br />Alex&#8217;s failed attempt at sneaking stealthily out of the house had woken me, and I had decided to follow him. Now I crouched, watching him intently as he walked onto the jetty, staring over the glistening lake. The wind was silent, and the moon stood proudly in the star-lit sky.<br />The surface was unmoving and flat like glass. Brown, algae covered glass. The lake was not the drawing feature of the area.<br />&#8220;You who reside in the lake, cometh! Lady of the Lake, will thou not show yourself?&#8221;<br />All seemed silent for an age, but as Alex stood, a single ripple moved across the dank pool.<br />&#8220;Please refrain from such speech patterns.&#8221;<br /> Alex stared, as a dark shadow began to appear. Robed in green and brown like the algae around her&#8230; actually, it seemed she was just covered in it like everything else. <br />&#8220;You&#8217;re real? You&#8217;re real!&#8221; Alex began to shout, running around in circles. <br />&#8220;Yeah. Sure. So, let&#8217;s see, how&#8217;s it go again&#8230;.&#8221; She cleared her throat. &#8220;You are the chosen one! I will bestow upon you a great gift of heroes, if you will convince the local council to clean up my waterways!&#8221;<br />His eyes widened, and he grinned stupidly. &#8220;YES!!!!!!!&#8221; <br />&#8220;Okay good. Here. She tossed a small steel dagger violently out of the pond, the blade flying dangerously past my head, and landing not far behind me. <br />&#8220;Take this dagger&#8230; uh&#8230; Burexcali. Okay, I&#8217;m going now. Fix my pond. Keep dagger. No questions? Good.&#8221; She disappeared beneath the lake, muttering.<br /><br />I stared at the weapon for a split second, before grabbing it and making a dash for the cabin. Behind me, I heard Alex talking to himself. He was still kneeling on the edge of the dock, staring stupidly into the smooth mould covered depths, where the lady had disappeared.<br /><br />I lay in bed, hoping my brother wouldn&#8217;t realize what had happened. He walked in, past me, like a man half asleep, not even giving me a second glance.<br />I stared at the roof. Had all that really happened? Or was all the Strawberry Pavlova I ate mixing with the Black Forest Cake? Suddenly guilt began to course through my veins, as I desperately tried to fall into slumber. This had been Alex&#8217;s great wish, years of work and condemnation. Stolen away. Thief. I lay in restless exhaustion, until sleep finally took me.<br /><br />I stared at the shimmering blade. So beautiful. Such lovely craftsmanship. No! Thief! Hypocrite. You don&#8217;t care about Alex. <br />It&#8217;s true. If there&#8217;s something I love more than my daily dose of sugary treats, then its shiny trinkets. Who am I kidding, it&#8217;s the other way round. All hail Meringue! Besides, didn&#8217;t brother always say magic dagger&#8217;s brought good luck? This was probably magic right? It came from that lady. <br />&#8216;You really think I&#8217;m beautiful?&#8217; <br />Strange, the thought appeared in my head as if the blade was speaking. Silly me. Either way, I couldn&#8217;t let this go to waste, such an alluring treasure.<br />&#8216;You will take me? Will you be my love? Promise.&#8217;<br />The blade fell from my hands, but as it did, I was already bending over, drawn toward it. I wanted to hold it.<br />&#8216;Show your love&#8230; take me.&#8217; I was going insane. Yes that was it. Maybe some Rocky-Road would help. Just wrap up the dagger, and hide it away&#8230; as my hand fell on the dagger, the world disappeared.<br /><br />I seemed to be floating, the world I knew null and void. Cold hands held me, a gentle yet stiff face was touching. &#8220;Do not fear, my love. You have made the contract, and now I will protect you for eternity.&#8221;<br />My eyes flashed opened as I hit the floorboards, greeting me with a pulsing headache. The dagger was in my hand, cold and silent.<br /><br />That night, after chowing down on more than my usual portion of Christmas pudding (don&#8217;t question me!), I ventured outside chilled to the bone. I doubt I need to mention my slight shivering was from more than the cold, as I held the dagger out before me under the crescent moon.<br />&#8216;We&#8217;re all alone, under a beautiful sky.&#8217; I really hope that was me. It wasn&#8217;t. It was raining, for goodness sake.<br />The blade began to slip from my hand, but it didn&#8217;t fall. It seemed to move forward of its own accord, becoming liquid as it did. It swirled and spun, rearranging itself. In an instant, she stood before me. &#8220;What do you think, my love?&#8221;<br /><br />So that&#8217;s how I met her. Or it. This is what my vacation has become. Hiding a love-crazed sentient-dagger from my star struck brother who&#8217;s still convinced he&#8217;s the chosen one. He searches every morning, hoping to pull the dagger from the pond slime, and be crowned king of absolutely nothing. <br />Two weeks of our trip passed when things got worse. Yes, you heard me right. W-O-R-S-E. <br />It was a Thursday afternoon, and there was knock at the door. As Alex opened it, he gasped. Their stood the lady of the lake, with an expression of complete exasperation. &#8220;What are you doing you dolt! What&#8217;s happening with my lake?&#8221;<br />He stared open mouthed. The lady stared into his eyes for a few seconds. <br />&#8220;Oh great. You spent this ENTIRE TIME searching for my dagger. Your thieving brother has it. He hid it in a muffin the night he stole it.&#8221;<br />Alex stared even more open mouthed. He turned, to look at me as I stood behind him, and then back at her. <br />&#8220;This is stupid. You, thief. Will you fix my pond? You can keep the dagger if you do.&#8221;<br />&#8220;No!&#8221; Alex was starting to come to his senses.<br />Finishing a mouthful of brownie, I tried to speak. &#8220;I&#8230;&#8221; <br />&#8216;Don&#8217;t do it, my love. Don&#8217;t let her trick you. You already have me.&#8217;<br />&#8220;Will you take the dagger away if I do?&#8221; &#8216;That&#8217;s not funny love&#8230;&#8217;<br />&#8220;No. I don&#8217;t want that wretch back. Ever.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Then no deal.&#8221;<br />&#8220;If you refuse, I will be violent!&#8221;<br />&#8220;Why?&#8221;<br />&#8220;Because you two have annoyed me far too much, and I haven&#8217;t had a chance to abuse my power for ages!&#8221;<br />&#8216;Don&#8217;t worry Adam, I won&#8217;t let my mother hurt you!&#8217;<br />What? Actually, at this point I&#8217;m not really surprised.<br />With a flash of swirling silver, the dagger-woman stood once again beside her beloved. My brother simply stared. <br />&#8220;Get out of my way child! The lady of the lake is here!&#8221; A golden sword appeared in her hand, a spear in the other.<br />&#8220;You will soon be lost in Antiquity!&#8221;<br />&#8220;You really were down there a long time mother.&#8221; The dagger-woman bristled, literally, as her body became covered in tiny silver blades in another swirling flash of silver. <br />At this point both I and my brother moved well out the way. As in, run away, away. A shout of &#8220;EXCALIBUR!&#8221; and the crash of the entire log cabin was blown to smithereens, a sure fire sign that it was the right decision. Grabbing what we could, we both jumped into Alex&#8217;s car and were out of their like the wind.<br /><br />Nothing untoward happened on the way back to the city. Alex dropped me off at my house, and said he would come back tomorrow to discuss what he called &#8216;paranormal events&#8217;.<br />Well, it seemed we had escaped the worst of it. Finally, my sponge cake and I could relax in peace. As I opened the door, there was a metallic ringing. A cold embrace. &#8220;Welcome home, my love.&#8221;<br />Please no.<br />
