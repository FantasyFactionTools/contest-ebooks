<div class="shortstory"><h1 id="story4">Den of Dreams</h1><h2 class="authorByline">By NightWrite</h2><p> Nothing was trustworthy here. Not in this place where bonecasters fled harsh eyes and illusions flowed like wine.  Others found the appeal, he knew. To hide away in their fantasy worlds. To bury their problems under illusions and drugs. It just made the waiting reality harsher when they fell. Bovuto struggled to keep his focus as he walked down the cramped, dark hallway towards Bozenya's office. Ears pushed back against his head, he fought temptation with each step. Slips of fantasies drifted out from the rooms which hedged his way. Rubbed against his senses. Offered him promises. Tried to drag him in. The scents of spiced tea and sea breeze mingled with Surasi incense and perfumes from across the sea. Sounds, from a thunderstorm to a rowdy festival, assaulted his ears in a cacophony of memories and dreams. The doors warped and twisted, from plain oak one moment to portals of fantasy the next. Floral arches, gem studded doors, a miniature of the great market arch found on the streets above. They were harder to fight than usual, but he pushed on. He had to focus. Bovuto wouldn't end up like other's under Bozenya's employ, those without bonecraft. He wouldn't be a toy, broken and molded to the whims of the sewer offal which called themselves his peers. So each day he made himself valuable to the boss. So long as he kept his value he'd be safe. Bovuto cursed to himself. His whiskers and tail twitched as his ears pulled tighter to his head. Something wasn't right. He drew upon his daemon and struck the opposing sides of the cramped hallway. His senses told him there were walls, but he felt no vibrations with his earthcraft. A similar lack of sensation occurred when clawed feet stomped against the ground. Why hadn't he noticed sooner. His earth-sense touched nothing, so where was he? “Your realization came quicker this time,” a voice called out around him. It deafened him, filled his being. Covering his ears did little as it reverberated throughout him. “Maybe we didn't give him enough draught of the forgetful.” A second voice assaulted him, softer yet no less powerful. “Perhaps some part of you remembers. Whispers to you how this isn't the first time.” “You're resilient,” the first said, “a useful trait I'm sure. No matter, our boss shall have the information we seek.” “Careful, too many doses this close together could unravel his mind. A blank slate won't get us what we need. Perhaps we should try a more direct approach.” The world pulled out from under Bovuto. Falling. Falling. Falling. Down into a deep abyss he fell, endless void hung around him. He tried to scream, but his throat constricted. When it felt like he'd fallen forever, Bovuto stopped. Suspended in the void in front of him hung two glowing figures. One a deep blue, the other verdant green. Their shape gave nothing away, formless and ever shifting. “Now then, “the blue one pulsed in rhythm with its speech, the voice matching the second. “It's very simple, our boss has two questions. The names out all bonecrafters under your employer’s purview. And the names of your little rathole's suppliers.” “Go drown,” he said, regaining his voice. “How rude. Such a mouth on this little sewer rat, wouldn't you say, Blue,” the green one said. Every aspect of him screamed out as the sensation of a thousand knives raked across his skin. Each fiber of fur was plucked one by one, whispers yanked out and tail dragged out with his spine. Layers of flesh peeled away to expose the soft core within, piece by slow piece. His body burned and his heart would surely burst. His throat went raw as he screamed for soothing release. His body returned to him and sagged as Blue pushed Green. The pain lingered as a phantom, but his balm had been granted. “Enough, Green. We don't want to break him,” Blue said, focusing on Bovuto, “at least not yet. You can have him as a plaything once we get what we want. Unless you bore with his struggles already.” Green said nothing, their presence fading away. “Petulant child,” Blue mumbled. “Now, let us continue. Though I hope you aren't naïve enough to proclaim you won't reveal anything. We've been teasing bits and pieces out for the past few days. We know about Lybrov, Berabor, Hyvel, and Tofn. But I'm sure there's more.“ The worried voice of his daemon rose up in his mind. His heart raced. How much did they know. He tried to pull up any of his magic, but it was weak with haste and confusion. “Now, now, none of that,” Blue said as something was forced down his throat. “No need to worry about that now. We let you keep it to keep up the illusion, but you won't need it now.” What little power he could cling to slipped away, feel apart before it began. Dreamsfoil, he cursed, and a potent batch of extract if it worked so fast. “Now, will you cooperate.” “You can still go drown. It won't change much.” “No, it wouldn't,” Blue paused to sigh. “This will be the last we speak. My boss grows impatient with the completion of his plans. You're now destined for the skittering pack of thugs which hide in his dens. I'm sure Green will be thrilled. Good-bye.” Another substance was forced down his throat and unconsciousness greeted him like an old friend</p>.</div>
