<br/>The pamphlet &#8211; attributed to the Sanctimonious Saints - had been right. Sex was not at all what the bishops would have you believe.<br/><br/>I pushed open the door to my house, tired after the late night. A quiet voice greeted me.<br/> <br/>&#8220;What do you think you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; Mother&#8217;s usual suspicious voice. She sat in a chair in the house&#8217;s main room, prayer book on her lap.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Coming home after staying at Ria&#8217;s last night.&#8221; I kept walking.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Oh?" Her tone stopped me. There was a note of confidence, like she had caught me at something she disapproved of. I had only heard that tone a few times in my life, but when I had, the conversation had never ended well for me. I turned to face her, and noticed a square clay jar striped with red resting on the small table next to her chair. That jar held the tea I used to keep myself infertile while exploring my body.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Why were you searching my room?&#8221; I yelled.<br/><br/>&#8220;I have the right to know what&#8217;s going on in my daughter&#8217;s life.&#8221; I could never decide whether I preferred to believe she postulated that or the priests had fed it to her.<br/> <br/>Mother spoke again. &#8220;I am disappointed.&#8221; Tears welled in her eyes. I didn&#8217;t care.<br/> <br/>&#8220;In me? No. You&#8217;re disappointed you don&#8217;t have the pious daughter you always wanted.&#8221; I knew better than to goad her, but Mother would never forgive the tea in that clay jar.<br/> <br/>&#8220;I am sending you to a nunnery.&#8221; Like that would make me pious. <br/> <br/>As I opened my mouth, Mother&#8217;s forehead creased, as it did every time she knew I was about to disagree with her. &#8220;I am not going to a fucking nunnery.&#8221; I screamed. It felt good. I strode out the door, then looked back at Mother over my shoulder. &#8220;I&#8217;m already fucked, aren&#8217;t I?&#8221;<br/> <br/>She glanced over at the jar. &#8220;It appears so.&#8221; Anguish fought with rage and despair. It seemed strange to hear my emotions in her voice.<br/> <br/>Ten paces later, I heard a crash behind me, followed by a door slamming shut. Mother had thrown the jar. It had shattered, and a slight breeze scattered the leaves inside. I didn&#8217;t need them anymore, but maybe I could sell them, if I collected them. I hurried over, pulling a handkerchief out of my skirt pocket.<br/> <br/>I picked up one of the shattered pieces, attempting to pour the leaves off it into my handkerchief. As I shook them off, I noticed a pattern etched on the inside. Runes.<br/> <br/>There were more on the other pieces. I forgot about the leaves &#8211; they had mostly blown away already &#8211; and gathered the pieces, wrapping them in the handkerchief before hurrying away. I did not want another confrontation with Mother.<br/> <br/>I would not go to a fucking nunnery and spend my days listening to unwed mothers pine after their loves and former prostitutes repent of their sins. Although, maybe I could get the nuns to exile me. That was my most promising option. I had heard that the Sanctimonious Saints would get people out, but I had been trying to contact them for months without any success.<br/> <br/>I found a bench in the park, set my bag under my feet, and pulled out the clay shards. I laid the pieces next to me and started organizing them, using the runes as a guide. Who had written words on the inside of a small infertility jar? Why?<br/> <br/>The last pieces revealed a large intricate design. It looked familiar, like one of the theocracy&#8217;s official seals, but not quite. Surely the priests weren&#8217;t trafficking in infertility teas; they always needed more people to build their altars.<br/><br/>Underneath the design, there was a short phrase. I murmured the words to myself as I read them. &#8220;You broke the jar; let&#8217;s see who you are.&#8221; I did not finish the last sentence. Another voice had joined mine. A woman stood behind the bench. She had short, spiky brown hair and wore a slim dress. Proper, yet flattering.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; she asked.<br/> <br/>I did not respond as she walked around the bench and sat down next to me, picking up one of the shattered pieces.<br/> <br/>&#8220;That&#8217;s mine,&#8221; I said. The woman looked down her nose at me. If she was trying to intimidate me, she failed.<br/> <br/>Her mouth twitched. She examined the shard in her hand, peering at the design. &#8220;Why did you break the jar?&#8221; she asked, looking over at me.<br/> <br/>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;<br/> <br/>She nodded. Her gaze traveled from the shards to my face, then down my shirt to my bag underneath my feet. I tensed my muscles, squeezing the bag with my shins. &#8220;You are a rebel.&#8221;<br/> <br/>Who was this woman? Did she come from a nunnery, recruiting wayward girls? I smiled at her. &#8220;And what are you going to do about it?&#8221;<br/> <br/>She held my eyes with hers. &#8220;What are you going to do about it?&#8221;<br/> <br/>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221; I stared at the woman, silently challenging her. I would never become a quiet, pious citizen.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221; The woman placed the shard back on the bench, smoothed her skirt, then stood up, and walked away.<br/> <br/>I watched her leave. One question dominated my thoughts: how had she known what the jar had said?<br/> <br/>Then stars exploded across my vision and pain erupted in my skull.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>I found myself lying on my side on a soft bed. My head throbbed. I groaned.<br/> <br/>Then I heard noises: a shuffling and a rustling. I opened my eyes, but could not see much. A dim glow illuminated markings etched in a wall opposite me. They looked like words, but in no language I knew.<br/> <br/>&#8220;It is time to choose.&#8221; I knew that voice. It was the woman who had asked about the jar. I sat up, too quickly. My vision faded, and I strained to bring it back. When it did, I took a deep breath as I looked at the woman. She wore the same clothes and impassive face as before.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; My voice creaked.<br/> <br/>&#8220;It depends on what you choose.&#8221;<br/> <br/>I refused to play her games. Not before I knew the rules. &#8220;What did you do to me?&#8221;<br/> <br/>&#8220;I did nothing.&#8221; Her face shifted to display mild innocence.<br/> <br/>I tried again. &#8220;What did you have done to me?&#8221;<br/> <br/>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to know the details. The outcome is what&#8217;s important.&#8221;<br/> <br/>&#8220;And what is that?&#8221;<br/> <br/>&#8220;Choose.&#8221;<br/> <br/>I opened my mouth to give in and ask her what I was supposed to choose, but before the words came out, her forehead creased. Like Mother&#8217;s when we fought. But I didn&#8217;t want to fight this woman until I knew exactly who and what I was fighting.<br/> <br/>I put my hand to my head, rubbing my temples to try and dull the throbbing while I thought. The woman had no way to know what I was going to say, but she knew I would say it quickly, without thinking, and that disappointed her. Why?<br/> <br/>I tried to remember our conversation from earlier. Had she talked about a choice? We talked about the broken jar, and she had accused me of being a rebel. And I&#8217;d said I wasn&#8217;t going to do anything about it. Was she recruiting for a nunnery?<br/> <br/>Did it matter?<br/> <br/>I brought my hands down from my head and looked the woman in the eye, despite my pounding heart and trembling fingers.<br/> <br/>&#8220;I choose to reject the saints and their pious, restrictive, controlling theocracy.&#8221;<br/> <br/>Three ponderous heartbeats later, the woman smiled and stuck out a hand.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Welcome to the Sanctimonious Saints.&#8221; <br/><br/><div class="possibleStory"><br/></div> <div class="possibleStory"><br/></div>
