There's no one here, and I can see you just fine."</p><p>"Just keep your voice down."</p><p>"The library's empty. I've checked."</p><p>"You can't be too careful."</p><p>"<em>You</em> can't be too careful. I don't even know why I'm here."</p><p>"I did it."</p><p>"Did what? Why couldn't this wait until morning?"</p><p>"I've mixed the potion, Artur! The Potion of Command Galidor mentioned in his historical journals."</p><p>"You did not."</p><p>"It's right here."</p><p>"Let me see that!"</p><p>"Well? Look at it!"</p><p>"Sure, this looks like a potion, Neesh. So do all the flasks we mixed last week."</p><p>"It's not a potion. It's <em>the</em> potion. Don't ask me what I had to go through to get my hands on a Yuk-Yuk's heart."</p><p>"What did you have to go through to get your hands on—?"</p><p>"I told you not to ask!"</p><p>"It probably wasn't even a real Yuk-Yuk. Old King Harold killed all the Yuk-Yuks, after his son's nose fell off. Every noble in Absenthia assumed he was snorting faerie dust."</p><p>"Look, I have it on extremely good authority that it was a Yuk-Yuk ... I mean, the flying possum from which the heart was cut ... and the instructions said that adding it would create a poof of green smoke that smelled specifically of mint and goat."</p><p>"I think one of those smells will overpower the other."</p><p>"Not for a nose like mine. The smoke was green, a nice poof of it, and the smell was minty goat."</p><p>"When have you ever spelled a minty goat?"</p><p>"The weight's just right, too. I checked it against the figures Galidor left in his journals."</p><p> </p><p>"Did you remember to add a half-crown for the weight of the flask?"</p><p>"Of course I remembered the half-crown. I'm not an idiot."</p><p>"Well, you did tell Alchemaster Palu that the difference between a Potion of Short Flight and Long Flight was the length of the feather you ground—"</p><p>"That was an honest mistake! And besides, you mixed up green sand and red in reagents class."</p><p>"That's because I'm colorblind, you insensitive dolt."</p><p>"Oh, right. Sorry, Artur. I just don't like it when you belittle me. Alchemaster Tonjold always belittles me, and you know what he thinks about smallfolk becoming alchemasters."</p><p>"Look, Tonjold's an old prick, and I'm not belittling you, Neesh. I'm just being realistic. I just don't think anyone is ever going to be able to replicate Galidor's Potion of Command."</p><p>"But I just did."</p><p>"Well, if you think so, how do you plan to test it?"</p><p>"That's why you're here."</p><p>"Oh, no."</p><p>"I'm going to drink the potion, and then I'm going to tell you to do something. If you do it—"</p><p>"Absolutely not happening."</p><p>"—then we'll know the potion works!"</p><p>"What were you going to tell me to do?"</p><p>"I don't know, um ... hop on one leg, maybe?"</p><p>"How would you know I'm not just messing with you?"</p><p>"Because you wouldn't do that! How long have we known each other, Artur?"</p><p>"Too long. Far too long."</p><p>"I know you wouldn't mess with me like that. You're nothing if not brutally honest."</p><p>"Well, I suppose that's true."</p><p>"So, stand right there, and I'll—"</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>"Hey, let go!"</p><p>"You can't just drink it, you dolt. What if you got the formula wrong?"</p><p>"I didn’t."</p><p>"You could end up attracting slugs, or turn into a purple mushroom and migrate spores all over the library, like that second year that ground up a tree frog."</p><p>"There's no tree frogs in this potion."</p><p>"Or you could end up burping crickets."</p><p>"Name one time that's happened."</p><p>"Potions Exhibition, last year. Dilution training, four months ago. Smell control, last—" </p><p>"Name one time recently."</p><p>"All I'm saying is, if you really think this does what it does, we should test it first. On someone else."</p><p>"Oh. Well ... let's think. Who do we know who's stupid enough to drink a potion without asking what it is?"</p><p>"We're at a school of potion makers, Neesh. The stupid ones never make it through the first year."</p><p>"Haha, true. Oh hey, do you remember that long-nosed guy from Estonir, the one with the ponytail? What was his name?"</p><p>"Lejo something."</p><p>"Lejori?"</p><p>"Yes, Lejori. That's the first and last time I've ever seen anyone projectile vomit their own tongue."</p><p>"Okay, fine, let's say we do it your way. We still need someone who's not part of the school."</p><p>"A mundane?"</p><p>"Why not? We'll just tell them it's a love potion or something."</p><p>"Love potions are illegal, and if he reports us—"</p><p>"He won't report us, Artur. They don't even let mundanes in the guild anymore, not since the last peasant uprising. Steward Snodgrass had to order eight-dozen new vials from the Illusion Embassy."</p><p>"Didn't they get into the reserves as well? Some rumor about strength potions they could use to bash through the king's guards?"</p><p>"Honestly, I think that's where all the new statues in the hedge maze came from."</p><p>"All right, so, we'll go find a mundane. But we're not going to tell them it's a love potion. Maybe a truth potion, instead."</p><p>"Ha! That's a bit ironic, isn't it?"</p><p>"Not if you know what that word means."</p><p>"I like this plan. I like it a lot. So, first thing tomorrow?"</p><p>"Yes. Fine. But we should only offer the mundane a single drop. Assuming Galidor's old journals aren't all donkey scat, a single drop should give him the power of command for ... ten minutes, tops."</p><p>"Say, um ... what if he commands us to give him more?"</p><p>"That's why we take a dropper, with one drop, and hide the rest of the potion in your room."</p><p>"Ooh, good idea."</p><p>"Mix up a bit of ForgetMeSo. We'll both take a drop before we leave tomorrow. That way, neither of us will know where the potion is, so even if he commands us to give it to him, we won't be able to. "</p><p>"But ... how will we find it again?"</p><p>"When the ForgetMeSo wears off. Assuming you mix it right, that's less than a day."</p><p>"Oh, good idea! That's why I always call you, Artur. You have all the good ideas."</p><p>"Well, Seven forbid, if you have managed to somehow replicate Galidor's Potion of Command, you'll be the one with all the good ideas, Neesh. They'll promote you to alchemaster for sure."</p><p>"Gosh, you really think so?"</p><p>"They promoted Bujor, and all he did was turn the Potion Master's cat into a slightly larger cat."</p><p>"Alchemixed milk, wasn't it?"</p><p>"He's lucky the cat didn't explode."</p><p>"Okay. I'll hide the potion tonight. Tomorrow, we prove it works, and tomorrow afternoon—"</p><p>"Alchemaster Neesh becomes the new head of the Galidor Restoration Project!"</p><p>"With his new Steward of Potions, of course, Artur Rainwater."</p><p>"I like the sound of Steward Rainwater. He sounds very rich."</p><p>"I could be Galidor, Artur! They could speak of me like Galidor someday!"</p><p>"Just remember to hide the potion better than the Potion of Flatulence you mixed last year, for Jester's Day. Old Bjord always turns down the bunks. If he turns down your bunk—"</p><p>"Seven take me, I couldn't go in the dorms for a week after that! But he won't find it."</p><p>"He'll drink anything he sees, Neesh. It's a compulsion he's had since he mixed up the ingredients in his Dietary Elixir. That's why they demoted him the Dorm Master."</p><p>"Head sheet washer, you mean. I still don't see why they don't just fire him."</p><p>"Honestly, how do you pass anything? He's the last member of Galidor's tenure track."</p><p>"Tenure track?"</p><p>"That's why you become an alchemaster, Neesh! So you get tenure. So no one can ever fire you."</p><p>"Oh, right."</p><p>"No one can fire Bjord even if he lacks the wits the Seven gave a caterpillar, which is why they have him turning down bunks."</p><p>"He won't find it. Besides, we'll be back before turn down."</p><p>"Just don't hide it in your bunk."</p><p>"I told you, Artur, I'm not an idiot!"</p><p>"I know. I know you're not an idiot, Neesh. I'm with you."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"We're doing this. We're going to be the toast of the Absenthia, thanks to your alchemical brilliance, and my political brilliance."</p><p>"But mostly my brilliance?"</p><p>"Whatever you want to put on the wall."</p><p>"Seven take me, Artur, we'll be famous!"</p><p>"And rich, remember, but only if your potion works."</p><p>"It'll work! I know it'll work!"</p><p>"Well I suppose we'll see tomorrow, won't we?"</p><p>THE END</p><p> </p></div>
