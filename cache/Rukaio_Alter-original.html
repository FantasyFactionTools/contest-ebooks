Peter Cross didn&#8217;t want to show it, but he was nervous.<br /><br />Not that that was a surprise mind. If sitting in a room with several of the greatest thieves in the world didn&#8217;t make you at least slightly nervous, you were either suicidally overconfident or just plain suicidal.<br /><br />Keeping his face a perfectly composed mask, Cross glanced to his left. Sitting beside him was Charles &#8216;Cutthroat&#8217; Taylor, one of the most ruthless men in the business. A silk scarf covered the scars on his neck where, rumour had it, he once slit his own throat to conceal a diamond beneath the skin. <br /><br />In the corner, playing Russian roulette with an old revolver was &#8216;Immortal&#8217; John, a man supposedly able to escape any life-threatening situation through pure luck alone. The constant empty click of the revolver as he checked chamber after chamber was the only noise in the empty room.<br /><br />Cross&#8217;s eyes moved to the man on his right. It was difficult to mistake the smooth black tuxedo worn by Pierre Voltaire or, as he preferred to be called, The Magician. Nobody knew how he got aware with his seemingly impossible heists. After all, a Magician never reveals his secrets.<br /><br />But, most dangerous of all, in Cross&#8217;s opinion, was the woman staring directly at him. Scarlett. The Woman of 50 Faces. A true Master of Disguise, able to impersonate almost anybody in the world, be they man or woman. Her most infamous feat was impersonating a groom on the night of his wedding day. And, somehow, consummating the marriage. Even Peter wasn&#8217;t sure how she did that.<br /><br />Scarlett winked at him. Peter felt a shudder go down his spine. <br /><br />They&#8217;d also briefly dated.<br /><br />Fortunately for his sanity, Peter was distracted from his raging sex drive by his watch beeping. He looked down at it and frowned.<br /><br />&#8220;Alright, I&#8217;m not unused to being played like a chump,&#8221; he said loudly. &#8220;But it&#8217;s been 30 minutes since we arrived here and there&#8217;s still no sign of our employer.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You suggest we leave?&#8221; Scarlett purred. &#8220;What a shame. I thought this whole mysterious business seemed&#8230; rather exciting.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Dodgy is what it is.&#8221; Taylor growled in a husky voice. &#8220;Anonymous employers are always a pain to deal with. Half the time they just end up being police stings. If this schmuck thinks he can order us around from the shadows, he&#8217;s painfully mistaken.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I assure you, Mr Taylor.&#8221; A voice blared from a speaker. &#8220;I have my reasons to stay secret.&#8221;<br /><br />Peter assumed the sudden announcement was meant to surprise and shock the group. Unfortunately, they were all professionals who had dealt with these sorts of power plays before, thus none of them reacted with little more than a raised eyebrow.<br /><br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about your reasons.&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not going to show yourself, I walk.&#8221;<br /><br />There was a chuckle over the speaker. &#8220;Very well. But I pray you keep your tempers in check.&#8221;<br /><br />The door clicked and in walked the most punchable man Peter had ever seen in his life. Every facet of this man, his suit, his posture, his walk, his billion dollar watch just screamed &#8216;rich, sleazy scumbag&#8217;. And his face&#8230; his face was twisted in a near constant sneer, so obnoxious that it practically invited violence.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh sod.&#8221; Taylor swore. &#8220;You&#8217;re that asshole Shrek guy.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Martin Shkreli.&#8217;&#8221; The man&#8217;s face flashed with annoyance.<br /><br />&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; Scarlett asked. &#8220;And why is he an asshole?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I am a revolutionary.&#8221; Shkreli sneered. Or at least Peter assumed it was a sneer. With a face that smug, everything seemed to come off as a sneer. &#8220;A man willing and able to cast off the shackles that bind the ordinary man and rise above the writhing masses to true greatness. However, such achievements invites contempt from the envious and untalented. Hence I am unjustly persecuted and slandered for my great accomplishments.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I see.&#8221; Scarlett turned to Taylor. &#8220;For real though, who is he?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;He&#8217;s a skeezy businessman who bought the rights to a life-saving drug and raised the price by 5000% solely for profit.&#8221; Taylor explained. &#8220;Then he acted like a douche when people called him out on it.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Wow.&#8221; Scarlett said, turning back to Shkreli. &#8220;You are an asshole.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;But Mr Skekeli, I thought you were supposed to have been arrested for tax fraud.&#8221; Peter said. &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s Shkreli.&#8221; Shkreli corrected through gritted teeth. &#8220;And I&#8217;m out on bail. Being a skeezy tax cheat- ahem, I mean, entrepreneur has its advantages.&#8221; <br /><br />&#8220;Then what have you hired us for?&#8221;<br /><br />Shkreli&#8217;s sneer widened into&#8230; a larger sneer. &#8220;It&#8217;s very simple. I want you to break into the main lab of Imprimis Pharmaceuticals.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh hell no,&#8221; Immortal John suddenly spoke. &#8220;I am not breaking into a pharmaceutical lab. I have seen 28 Days Later. And Resident Evil. No good can come of this.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s not a dangerous lab, you moron.&#8221; Shkreli sneered. &#8220;I thought you were supposed to be a professional.&#8221;<br /><br />Immortal John blinked. Slowly.<br /><br />&#8220;Say, would anyone here object if I punched this guy in the face?&#8221; He asked. <br /><br />There was a chorus of &#8216;nopes&#8217; from Taylor and Scarlett. Peter, on the other hand, was more composed.<br /><br />&#8220;I understand the urge,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but maybe wait until he&#8217;s explained the job before we punch his teeth out.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;W-Wait, we?&#8221; A drop of sweat ran down Shkreli&#8217;s brow. <br /><br />Peter didn&#8217;t say anything. He simply leaned back in his chair and folded his arms.<br /><br />Lacking much of his previous swagger, Shkreli continued his story. &#8220;Well, I want you to steal a certain formula from Imprimis Pharmaceuticals. You see, they created a successful alternative to our drug, Daraprim-&#8220;<br /><br />&#8220;The one you price-gouged dying people for?&#8221; Scarlett asked.<br /><br />&#8220;Y-Yes, that one.&#8221; Shkreli wiped his brow. &#8220;Anyway, that drug will cut into our market. So I want you to steal it and wipe away the competition.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;And what&#8217;s in it for us?&#8221; Taylor asked. &#8220;Because, I&#8217;ll be honest, you&#8217;d need to pay a lot of money just to get me out of this room without punching your face off.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yes, but I have something far more priceless than money.&#8221; Shkreli said, a touch of his former smugness creeping into his voice. &#8220;Something only I can provide. Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Look, I do not need to know what you got up to in Shaolin.&#8221; Immortal John said bluntly. &#8220;As far as I&#8217;m concerned, with a face and personality like that, you shouldn&#8217;t even be allowed to breed.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;He&#8217;s talking about the Wu-Tang Clan album.&#8221; Taylor explained. <br /><br />&#8220;Oh.&#8221; John said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t listen to hiphop.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;They&#8217;re a band, dumbass.&#8221; Taylor explained. &#8220;Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is an album they made and released one copy of. And Shitkicker here bought it.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s Shkreli!&#8221; Shkreli snapped. He then immediately backed down when Taylor raised a fist. &#8220;B-b-b-but you&#8217;re right! I have the only copy in the world. And I&#8217;m willing to let you all have a listen to it, provided you accomplish this job for me.&#8221;<br /><br />The group exchanged glances.<br /><br />Peter spoke up. &#8220;Look, Mr Sugarlala-&#8220;<br /><br />&#8220;Shkreli.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Whatever.&#8221; Peter continued. &#8220;You seem like a perfectly nice guy-&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No he doesn&#8217;t.&#8221; Scarlett said.<br /><br />&#8220;&#8230;True.&#8221; Peter admitted. &#8220;You seem like a complete asshole, but your deal is very tempting. In fact, I think we need a few minutes outside to talk over your offer.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Very well.&#8221; Shkreli nodded. &#8220;The door is over there. Try not to scuff the carpet.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Are you sure I can&#8217;t punch him before we leave?&#8221; Immortal John asked as he was escorted out. &#8220;Just a little?&#8221;<br /><br />Peter tried to hold in his sigh of relief. Shkreli hadn&#8217;t noticed any irregularities. Not that Peter thought that egomaniac would notice anything odd. Not even that one of the group was a body double. <br /><br />Now he could only hope that their accomplice had pulled off his end of the plan&#8230;<br /><br /><br /><br />A few minutes later, Shkreli was pacing through the corridors of his building. For some reason, the conversation with the thieves had left him with a lingering nervousness. And not just because they&#8217;d had an intense discussion on the way out about whether or not to kick his face in. Come to think about it, it was odd that Pierre, the Magician, hadn&#8217;t said a word throughout the entire meeting.<br /><br />To settle his nerves, Shkreli decided to travel to his secret underground vault and listen to his exclusive album while also partaking in his usual puppy/kitten kicking. However, when he reached said vault, he found the door swinging wide open.<br /><br />In panic, Shkreli opened the safe to his album, only to find his prized possession missing and one solitary note left behind.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="center">Dear Shukrayli.<br /><br />We&#8217;re thieves, remember? Thanks for giving us access to your building so we could steal your album.<br /><br />Yours Sincerely, Pierre Voltaire and other Criminals with Standards.</div><br /><br /><br />Fists shaking, Shkreli crumpled the note. Then, leaning his head back to the sky, he let out one solitary scream.<br /><br />&#8220;THAT&#8217;S SHKRELI!!!&#8221;<br />
