<br/>Me and the boys had set up in Mackie&#8217;s barn for the meeting so we could make a quick escape if the coppers bust in. Jmack, that old goat, was out of town so we had the place to ourselves. We set up by the table, loaded with some grass to smoke, a result from our last heist. I&#8217;d told m3m to keep watch out by the door so nothing would disturb our little business. It was hard finding the right allies in this world of ours. Some grass cigars lit up the dim-lit room, the smoke circled the wood beams supporting the ceiling.<br/><br/>&#8216;You all know why I gathered you here in San Fantastico.&#8217; I opened with a voice heavy with emotion. <br/>Most members of the familia had made it, some faces were missing. Tolkien was working on something new after all this time I heard, George R. R. was always late. Some might turn out to be traitors, left us with unfinished business. San Fantastico was a dangerous city.<br/><br/>&#8216;I like my family. Family means loyalty, family means trust, family means certainty in a world of coppers and honest law and eager politicians. The world used to be simple, it was those with power and those without but no more.&#8217;<br/>There was an uneasiness in the room, I left it hanging. Let them sweat a bit instead. It was a painful necessity to give them the long silence treatment. Then I hit the message home. &#8216;We&#8217;ve got a mole boys.&#8217;<br/><br/>It took a moment before the weight of the words settled. Knives were sharpened, trust fleeted away like piss down a drain and brothers, sisters, cousins eyed each other with suspicion. They were wary, they were murderous, they were dangerous. Dangerous but necessary.<br/><br/>My eyes passed the gathered family in distress, loyal every one of them, once. Beatricea tried to look anywhere but to the others, quite a feat if you consider the crowd she was in. Radley Rarewood&#8217;s nostrils flared, he demanded blood. Aunty Ty from Down Under looked at everyone&#8217;s legs (happens if you are upside down). Nora, a vagabond, cussed in a strange eldritch tongue and cousin Gem was scribbling notes on the table, unaware he&#8217;d run out of paper a long time ago. <br/>Xia, his name suspected a Chinaman, kept his cool though. His inquiry was direct, no nonsense, I appreciated that. His question struck through the family like a musician&#8217;s instrument through a crowd and silenced them.<br/><br/>&#8216;Who is it, Henry? Do you know?&#8217;<br/><br/>It was the question I had anticipated and I was ready for it.<br/>I looked at him intently, ready for the effect my words would have-<br/><br/>&#8216;Henry! Dinner time boy!&#8217; a voice echoed from the farmhouse. A loud cacophony of mewling and hissing erupted as the cats scattered, leaving behind a table with ravaged catnip, Nora cussing and Lady Ty stuck on her head, her floppy ears bent. <br/>&#8216;Sorry guys.&#8217; Henry said as he licked his paw. &#8216;Big reveal some other time; next RP session in the King&#8217;s Paws?&#8217;<br/><br/>
