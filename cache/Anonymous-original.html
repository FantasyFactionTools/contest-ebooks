The wizard checked his sword belt; it was still secure. He almost felt regret that it was so. With a silent prayer, he opened the door.<br /><br />A bell rang softly in the depths of the store as the door swung shut behind him. Shelves stood in front of windows, housing hundreds of bottles of every size and shape and hue. Rainbow shafts of light pulsed unnaturally, warped by the eternal swirling of the bottles' contents. The shopkeeper was nowhere to be seen; the counter was clear, except for a pile of unopened parcels.<br /><br />A voice spoke from the depths of the shop. "I'll just be a minute."<br /><br />Icewind inhaled deeply&#8212;the place was filled with the aroma of enticing spices, undercut by the distinctive scent of smoke. He drifted along the shelves, perusing the bottles' yellowed labels. Tinctures for the mind. Cures for common ailments. Potions for love, or luck, or joy. Every petty thing on which small-minded commoners would waste their money; nothing even close to what he needed.<br /><br />But hidden powers lurked within this place. He felt it in his bones.<br /><br />The shopkeeper hurried over, groaning as he set down a crate of potions. A short, fat alchemist with patchy hair, he didn't look like much. He hesitated. "Would you mind if I shelve these first?"<br /><br />Icewind waved him on.<br /><br />"I'm Elric by the way." The shopkeeper shoved the bottles onto the shelves. He didn't seem to pay much attention to what went where, and instead crammed each one into any vacant crevice. Once the crate was empty, he bowed to Icewind. "How may I help?"<br /><br />"This is a little embarrassing. I'm looking for a potion&#8212;"<br /><br />"Potion, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">potion, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">potion...</span>"<br /><br />The alchemist raised an eyebrow.<br /><br />"Sorry about that." Icewind cleared his throat. "I'm looking for an elixir. It has to prevent&#8212;"<br /><br />"Prevent, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">prevent, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">prevent...</span>"<br /><br />The shopkeeper frowned and looked Icewind up and down.<br /><br />The wizard shifted awkwardly. Better to ignore it&#8212;now was not the time. "It has to hide me from someone."<br /><br />"Woman troubles?" The alchemist nodded sagely. "Well... first you'll need something to get rid of that enchant&#8212;"<br /><br />"That's not necessary. I just don't want her to see me."<br /><br />"But what about those echoes?"<br /><br />"I can deal with them. What I can't do is get away from her. I'd make the elixir myself, but I'm between places&#8212;"<br /><br />"Places, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">places, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">places...</span>"<br /><br />Icewind's hand twitched toward the hilt of his sword.<br /><br />"You can hardly finish a sentence. You're sure you don't want&#8212;"<br /><br />"I'm sure. It's best to just ignore it."<br /><br />"It's likely a simple spell. It would be no problem&#8212;"<br /><br />"Problem, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">problem, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">problem...</span>"<br /><br />The alchemist was speechless for a moment. "That's... not normal. You need to get that seen to."<br /><br />"I just need the elixir."<br /><br />"Are you sure I can't persua&#8212;"<br /><br />"Persuade, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">persuade, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">persuade...</span>"<br /><br />"Just leave it alone. Please."<br /><br />"Please, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">please, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">please...</span>"<br /><br />"Is it just words beginning with a 'p'?"<br /><br />"Pee, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">pee, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">pee...</span>"<br /><br />"Apparently."<br /><br />"Fascinating. I'd really like to&#8212;"<br /><br />"I'm sorry, but I just want the elixir. I know what's causing the echoes."<br /><br />"I'm sure you do, but&#8212;"<br /><br />"It's not important. Do you have the elixir or not?"<br /><br />"Of course, but its effects might be interfered with by the spell. If I could just&#8212;"<br /><br />"It's not a spell. Perhaps&#8212;"<br /><br />"Perhaps, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">perhaps, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">perhaps...</span>"<br /><br />"What else could it be?"<br /><br />Icewind gritted his teeth. "If you don't have something prepared&#8212;"<br /><br />"Prepared, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">prepared, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">prepared...</span>"<br /><br />"I've heard of a spell like that before. It drove the man insane. It would take me little time to&#8212;"<br /><br />"It's not a spell."<br /><br />"This man thought so too, but&#8212;"<br /><br />"Please&#8212;"<br /><br />"Please, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">please, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">please...</span>"<br /><br />"He was cured, and&#8212;"<br /><br />"Just hold on a minute&#8212;"<br /><br />"I love studying this kind&#8212;"<br /><br />"I'm the customer here, so&#8212;"<br /><br />"I'll make your elixir for free if you let me&#8212;"<br /><br />"You won't be able to help! Like I said&#8212;"<br /><br />"Decoding spells is my passion&#8212;"<br /><br />"Passion, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">passion, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">passion...</span>"<br /><br />"&#8212;and this one looks extremely interesting&#8212;"<br /><br />"I'm sorry, but it's&#8212;"<br /><br />"&#8212;such spells are not&#8212;"<br /><br />"It's not a&#8212;"<br /><br />"I'd consider myself in your debt&#8212;"<br /><br />"IT'S MY SWORD!"<br /><br />The shopkeeper paused mid-word.<br /><br />Icewind massaged his temples.<br /><br />"Uh... Excuse me?"<br /><br />The wizard sighed. "I have a talking sword. It's annoyed with me. It's been doing this for days."<br /><br />The alchemist looked incredulous.<br /><br />The wizard shrugged. "Its sense of humour is... awful."<br /><br />"Awesome, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">awesome, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">awesome...</span>"<br /><br />The two men stared at the sword.<br /><br />"That's... How does one upset a <em>sword?"</em><br /><br />"It's a long story."<br /><br />"Okay..." The alchemist shook himself. "I'd like to apologise. Decoding spells is my hobby, and I thought..."<br /><br />Icewind dismissed it with a wave of his hand. "It's fine&#8212;Elric, was it? I understand."<br /><br />"Thank you. So, you're looking for a concealment elixir?"<br /><br />"Do you have something ready-made?"<br /><br />"It's not an everyday request." Elric scratched his head. "A few deliveries arrived today, I think what you're looking for might be in one of them. I've been waiting for a variety set to arrive."<br /><br />"I'd be happy to help look through the par&#8212;"<br /><br />"Parcels, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">parcels, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">parcels...</span>"<br /><br />"Thanks, but you probably wouldn't know what you're looking for."<br /><br />"I'm familiar with alchemy."<br /><br />Elric looked skeptical. "Many are, but few have&#8212;"<br /><br />"I'm a mage."<br /><br />The alchemist straightened. "I see. And the woman?"<br /><br />"She's a witch."<br /><br />Elric stared at Icewind for a moment, biting his lip. He took a deep breath. "I guess it can't hurt."<br /><br />Icewind rolled his eyes and reached for the closest box&#8212;which was much lighter than expected. He opened it, and paused in confusion. It had a cake inside. "Elric?"<br /><br />The alchemist leaned over to take a look. "Aha! That's from across the road. The baker trades me cakes for tonics." He licked his lips.<br /><br />Brightedge spoke up at last, his tone reproachful. "Cake? You'd better let me cut it this time."<br /><br />"For the love of&#8212;"<br /><br />Elric blinked. "Your sword wants to cut the <em>cake?"</em><br /><br />"It's what we fell out over."<br /><br />"He wouldn't let me do it. Heartless bastard."<br /><br />Icewind rolled his eyes. "And look how that turned out."<br /><br />The sword sighed. "That's beside the point."<br /><br />Elric frowned. "What is?"<br /><br />"I threw the cake out the window. It exploded."<br /><br />"It <em>what?"</em><br /><br />"Yeah. <em>She</em> had sent it."<br /><br />"Ah..."<br /><br />"She's been just one step behind me ever since. That's why I need this potion."<br /><br />"Potionpotion<em>potion</em>. You two are getting sidetracked. There's nothing wrong with <em>this</em> cake. Let's cut it now."<br /><br />Icewind glared at the sword. "We're busy."<br /><br />"Actually, it's not a bad idea. There's a lot of boxes."<br /><br />"I'm not sure&#8212;"<br /><br />Brightedge cut in. "It'll be more than just words beginning with 'p' if you say no."<br /><br />Wizard and sword glared at each other for a moment.<br /><br />Elric looked from one to the other, then stood up. "Cake it is. I'll go get some drinks&#8212;you can cut it if you like!" He disappeared into the back of the shop.<br /><br />Brightedge glittered with glee.<br /><br />"Okay. Swear you'll stop with the echoes after this?"<br /><br />"That's fair."<br /><br />Icewind tried to look stern. "Just make sure you savour it." He moved a couple of boxes out of the way, drew the sword, and slowly, carefully, cut the cake.<br /><br />Brightedge chattered to itself, its voice ringing with delight. Each cut brought forth squeals of joy as the blade sliced through the icing and into the layers beneath. Once the last cut was made, the sword sighed contentedly. "Whoever invented cake deserves to be showered with gold."<br /><br />The wizard rolled his eyes, wiped the sword clean, and slid it back into its scabbard. "You'd better keep your promise."<br /><br />"Promise, <span style="font-size: 10px;" class="bbc_size">promise, </span><span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">promise...</span>"<br /><br />"Don't you dare&#8212;"<br /><br />Brightedge giggled. "Sorry. Couldn't resist."<br /><br />The shopkeeper returned a minute later with a wine bottle and two glasses. "I hope this one's good." He poured the wine, his hands shaking slightly. The cobalt liquid flashed and shimmered with every movement, filled with sparks of light which moved in neverending whirls.<br /><br />Icewind picked up the glass, mesmerised, and tilted it from side to side. "What <em>is</em> it?"<br /><br />"Something I created." Elric smiled nervously. "It's like a sparkling wine, but it packs a greater punch. You'll be the first to try it!" He poured himself a glass as well.<br /><br />The wizard raised his drink&#8212;"Cheers!"&#8212;and took a generous mouthful. It was glorious&#8212;silky smooth, a taste like the most exotic fruits, and it left a tingling on his tongue. He savoured it for a moment, then swallowed. "That's incredible!"<br /><br />Elric put his glass down and took a deep breath.<br /><br />Icewind frowned. "What..." The taste of the wine was fading, but the tingling feeling wasn't. It intensified, began to spread&#8212;from his stomach now as well.<br /><br />The glass fell from his hand, shattered on the flagstones; he struggled to stay upright.<br /><br />"I'm sorry. She knew you would come here. I almost didn't realise you were the one."<br /><br />The store began to spin, and then dissolved into shadows.<br />
