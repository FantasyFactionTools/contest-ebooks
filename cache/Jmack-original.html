<br /><strong>ALL THAT GLITTERS</strong><br /><br />The first time Becca saw Stephen do magic, she gasped with wonder. It was behind the King's Paws, and she was smoking a fag. He stepped out the back of the pub to answer his mobile. He listened, went very still, and began to chant. It was so weird Becca wouldn't have stuck around if he hadn't been so bloody handsome. He began to glow, and she decided to watch a bit. When his clothes faded away, and he stood there in golden glory, she decided she was in love. Too soon, the clothes came back, and the light faded away. Stephen put away his phone, patted his hair, then went back inside as though nothing had happened. Becca fanned herself for a few minutes, then went back in to work.<br /><br />After that, Becca watched Stephen like a cat whenever he came to the pub, but it was some weeks before it happened again. He was nursing a pint, when his phone chimed. He put it to his ear, then went straight out the back. Becca tossed down her towel and started to follow.<br /><br />"Here now!" said the landlord. "Where do you think you're going? A guest just sat down!"<br /><br />Becca glanced over at her section and was surprised to see a midget waiting. You didn&#8217;t see that every day, but she was in a hurry. "You can sort a little thing like that, right?&#8221; She didn&#8217;t wait to hear what the guvnor said back.<br /><br />Out in the alley, Stephen stood with his back to her, glowing again, and fit as a god. He was smooth and muscled. His arms depended from broad shoulders and finished in fine hands, one of which he held out in front, clearly taking a selfie. He was so, so beautiful. Becca moaned softly way back in her throat, and Stephen must have heard. He turned and gave her a look that burned deep, deep into her soul. She couldn&#8217;t look away. Her head spun, and the ground rushed up.<br /><br />She faded back into the world and realized she was on a bench in the Paws. Her head was in someone's lap. The someone was Stephen, and he was looking down at her with tender concern.<br /><br />"She's alright now," he said. His voice was refined, like the BBC. "You had us worried."<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll just pass out again right here," whispered Becca, staring up at his perfect chin.<br /><br />"That's understandable," he said, smiling.<br /><br />"Don't think you're getting paid for the last fifteen minutes, Becca,&#8221; said the landlord. "You&#8217;ve scared off the clients."<br /><br />"Now, now," said Stephen. "I'm sure she'll be alright in no time."<br /><br />"And what about that midget?" continued the man. "He left before he got his goat cheese."<br /><br />Stephen stood abruptly, letting Becca&#8217;s head thump on the bench. &#8220;Goat cheese? Where?" he demanded. "Where was he?&#8221;<br /><br />Becca sat up while the landlord pointed at her section. "Over there he was.&#8221;<br /><br />"Was he Irish?" Stephen demanded.<br /><br />&#8220;He sure had the accent,&#8221; said the landlord. &#8220;Told me to pull him a Beamish, then asked for some crackers and goat cheese. Like I have goat cheese every day.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;How did he find me?! I have to get out of here,&#8221; said Stephen, tossing down a ten pound note. He paused at a window to check his reflection, then made for a Jaguar across the lane. <br /><br />He was back in thirty seconds, complaining loudly. "It's been clamped!&#8221;<br /><br />"I've told you not to park there," said the landlord. "It was only a matter of time."<br /><br />&#8220;I can drive," said Becca, surprising herself.<br /><br />&#8220;You're not fit to drive," said Stephen. Becca&#8217;s heart sank. "But," he went on, and her heart leapt, &#8220;I can drive while you recover. I&#8217;ll turn the keys and the car back over to you when we're where we're going."<br /><br />"Where&#8217;s that?" asked Becca.<br /><br />"Into the tales people tell around the fire on Midsummer night, girl.&#8221; Becca wondered if she'd be home to her mum in time for tea.<br /><br />Outside, Stephen snatched a canvas sack from his boot, and put it into Becca's back seat. He helped her into the car, closed her door like a gentleman, then slid behind the wheel.<br /><br />When they&#8217;d got to the M1, Stephen turned soulful grey eyes on her. &#8220;What did you see in the alley?" <br /><br />"Er," said Becca.<br /><br />"It's alright," he said, his voice reassuring. <br /><br />&#8220;Um - I mean - I think I saw&#8230; magic?&#8221; said Becca. She could hardly meet his gaze. She sounded ridiculous.<br /><br />"Yes. Yes, you did, Becca. Very old magic."<br /><br />A thumping sound came from the back seat. "What's that?" asked Becca.<br /><br />"More old magic," he said. The thumping grew stronger, then Becca heard a distinct honk.<br /><br />"It sounds like a goose."<br /><br />"As I said, very old magic." Stephen glanced into the driver's mirror and must not have liked what he saw. He twisted it around to get a clearer view of his face, turning his chin to one side then the other. His eyes left the roadway. Then the car did.<br /><br />Becca's stomach rose as her car fell, then slapped down as it hit the ground, the dampers bottoming out. The car bounced as it plowed through underbrush and mowed down small trees before slamming to a stop. Airbags exploded around them.<br /><br />"Wha?" mumbled Becca after a stunned minute. It had all happened so quickly she couldn't fully process anything except the ringing in her ears and a burning across the skin of her face. "What?" she croaked. She looked over and saw Stephen slumped over the wheel. There was glass all over him, all over the front dash, the seats, herself. "Ow, fuck." She was bleeding from a lot of cuts. "Ow, fuck!" She started to cry.<br /><br />"Oh, poor little lassie!" said a voice outside the car. Becca scrubbed her eyes. A midget was standing on the bonnet of the car, dressed in a green suit like the character on the cereal box and glaring at her through what used to be the windshield. "It's what you get for collaborating with the likes of him."<br /><br />"What?" <br /><br />The little man stomped closer, standing easily on the crushed metal of the bonnet. "What? What?" he mocked. "Can't say anything more than that?" He spat a stream of brown liquid into the bushes.<br /><br />Leprechaun, thought Becca, and started giggling. &#8220;Lucky Charms!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Stop that!&#8221; snapped the man.<br /><br />"Lucky Charms!&#8221; Becca pointed a shaky finger. "Leprechaun!"<br /><br />"And what if I am? He's a witch, I'm a leprechaun, and you're a twit."<br /><br />"Ohh," moaned Stephen. His eyes opened, but looked glazed over.<br /><br />&#8220;We&#8217;re bleeding,&#8221; Becca told the leprechaun.<br /><br />&#8220;And what&#8217;s that to me?&#8221; said the leprechaun.<br /><br />&#8220;Can you help us?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Why would I do that?&#8221; laughed the little man. &#8220;I pulled the road out from under you. I did this to you. And you want me help? Want to steal my pot at the end of the rainbow? Catch me and ask for wishes?&#8221;<br /><br />Becca started crying again, though she wasn&#8217;t sure why.<br /><br />&#8220;I tell you what,&#8221; said the leprechaun. &#8220;You give me that sack from the rear seat, and I&#8217;ll be on me way. Once I&#8217;m gone, I&#8217;ll put the road back, and you&#8217;re on your way.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Is my face cut?&#8221; whinged Stephen, pawing glass from his hair and skin.<br /><br />&#8220;Why should I give it over?&#8221; said Becca.<br /><br />The leprechaun reached into his green velvet coat and pointed the barrel of a huge old-fashioned gun between Becca&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Because I&#8217;ll fecking shoot your head off if you don&#8217;t. Is that a good enough reason, lass?&#8221;<br /><br />Becca groped behind her quickly. The sack was heavy and awkward, and the creature inside didn&#8217;t want to stay still. But she managed to pull it to the front, and the leprechaun snatched it away. He looked inside, and grunted in satisfaction. &#8220;There you are,&#8221; he cooed. The sack honked back at him. A tiny bell chimed in mid-air, and a wide grin spread across the leprechaun&#8217;s face. He reached in and pulled out a gleaming, gold-colored egg. &#8220;Aye, and you&#8217;re glad to see me old self again, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;<br /><br />The leprechaun turned a black look on Becca. &#8220;Do yourself a favor, girl&#8221; he said. &#8220;Find a nice, dull fellow who&#8217;s not a witch, a thief or a gigolo. Or all three, like this dobber.&#8221; He hefted the sack, hopped off the bonnet and disappeared.<br /><br />Becca stared daggers over at Stephen. &#8220;What was all that rubbish, then?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I only borrowed the goose,&#8221; he complained. &#8220;It&#8217;s expensive, living, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;And what was that with the magical selfies in the alley?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Advertising! You don&#8217;t expect women to hire me sight unseen, do you?&#8221;<br /><br />Becca watched Stephen disappear in her rearview mirror as she pulled her wreck of a car onto the tarmac, which had reappeared just like leprechaun had promised. The handsome witch shouted angry curses after her but his words were lost in the clatter of her wheels throwing gravel. <br /><br />&#8220;Sod magic,&#8221; thought Becca, hoping it wasn&#8217;t too late for tea.<br /><br />
