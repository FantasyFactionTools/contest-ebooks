This time, the students were birds, which was why iron rods barred the ceiling window of the lecture hall. Professor Stark told them about one eighth-form boy that left the window open as a joke, and an entire class of sixth-formers flew off, never to be seen again. <br /><br />Birds today - white potions smelling of feathers and rain - dogs last week. That first transformation had been a wild mess as the class tried to understand how to hold on to their human minds. But they&#8217;d learned, and now most of them calmly perched on the rafters. <br /><br />Nothing in magic is as cool as this, Brand thought, folding his wings and coming to rest on a beam. One little potion and you were a dog, an eagle, or... anything you had a potion for. So far, they&#8217;d learned to mix the potions and most could resist the instincts surging in their transformed bodies, but they&#8217;d no idea how it all worked. &#8220;You&#8217;re not ready for that yet&#8221; were Brand&#8217;s absolute least favorite words.<br /><br />And some students <em>weren't</em> ready. A sparrow-girl was flitting carelessly through the air until a hawk-boy dropped onto her unprotected back, talons wide. Suddenly, an explosive clap shook the room, and green smoke filled every corner. Nineteen students dropped to the floor, enchantments stripped away like mist before the sun. Professor Stark pulled the hawk-boy off the girl, Mathia, the best student in the whole sixth form.<br /><br />"Shame on you! Control yourself!" Stark shook him hard, until his eyes focused. Then she rounded on Mathia. "And you! You may know books, but if you cannot master the effects of a potion, you've learned nothing!"<br /><br />Brand looked down on his classmates from the rafters. He'd inhaled just the smallest bit of the green smoke that broke the enchantments, and found he could balance between human and bird. He let it go, dropping softly to the floor while the Professor droned on and on. <br /><br />He patted a vial in the pocket of his robe, where he&#8217;d saved back enough eagle potion to practice on his own.<br /><br />........<br /><br />The next day, hawk-boy was gone. They'd packed his bags in the middle of the night, and sent him off on the morning ferry, back to home and normal life. Mathia was dropped back eight places, to an embarrassing middle desk - right next to Brand&#8217;s.<br /><br />It was Thursday - Philosophy and Origins of Magic, which was usually long on philosophy and short on origins. Brand&#8217;s mind wandered, until he glanced at Mathia. Her mouth was open and her eyes were riveted on Professor Stark. If Mathia was learning something new, maybe Brand should pay attention.<br /><br />"In tranformations, what is the source of each creature, each thing we become?" That&#8217;s easy, thought Brand. Each potion was based on ingredients. They were the source. "This term, you've been learning the secret name for each powder, each tincture, each extract. But the names of each, while extremely important, and you must memorize, memorize, memorize - these names aren&#8217;t the things themselves."<br /><br />&#8220;Indeed, they are not,&#8221; said an accented voice at the classroom door. Nineteen heads swiveled to see a stick-like old man ducking his head through the doorway. "A name is not the thing itself.&#8221; Brand craned to see over the front row of students, who were half standing in their chairs to get a better look. "Think of meat," continued the stranger. &#8220;Do we call it flesh? or muscle? No! Pig becomes pork. Cow linguistically transforms into beef. It all sounds so much... cleaner.&#8221;<br /><br />Professor Stark interrupted. "Class, please greet your instructor for today, the honorable Mal Zabir." She gave the man her best glare. "Master Zabir, do try not to give my students nightmares.&#8221;<br /><br />Mal Zabir continued as though she hadn't spoken. "<em>Coripanish</em> has an exotic sound, does it not? But that is only because it is ancient Lemurian. Our modern tongue would render it as - extract of house cat."<br /><br />"Gross!" sang the students, except for Brand and Mathia.<br /><br />"Yesterday, when you were flitting about in the air, were you thinking where the <em>gentabus</em> powder came from for making starling potions? Or the <em>arginish</em> for an owl?&#8221; Mal Zabir crooked a finger, and two slyly grinning eighth-formers carried in a tall cupboard bound with metal chains and padlocks. He spoke a single Word of power, and the chains clanked to the floor in a heap. "Today you will learn the true source of transformational potions.&#8221; He spread the cupboard doors wide.<br /><br />Inside, rows of tiny wooden drawers framed a little worktable covered with strange apparatus. A glass cylinder was suspended from a metal arm attached to the back of the cabinet. Its surface was steamed with condensation, but something moved inside, scrabbling at the glass with tiny claws.<br /><br />"Behold the common grey squirrel!" Mal Zabir flipped a switch on the worktable, and a current of power entered the glass. The squirrel began to scream. "<em>Parsivirex</em>,&#8221; said Mal Zabor over the noise. &#8220;What a lovely word for extract of squirrel." The power rose and rose to a high pitch, until with a gruesome pop, the squirrel exploded in red blood and grey hair, painting the inside of the cylinder.<br /><br />The class erupted, and one student at the front was ill. Brand studied the cabinet. There were so many drawers, and some were secured with tiny, brass locks. Mathia caught his eye, and for the first time in a long while, Brand felt a connection with a fellow student.<br />.....<br /><br />"If they don't want us to break into things," said Brand, "they shouldn't teach us acids." He blew away the last of the acrid smoke and swung open the doors of Mal Zabir's cupboard. "Told you it wouldn't take long."<br /><br />"I could have used a spell," said Mathia.<br /><br />"And woken half the teachers. They've got alarms for spell-casting, remember.&#8221;<br /><br />They studied the opened cabinet in the dim light from a shuttered lamp. The apparatus and its awful results had been removed, but what interested Brand were the twenty brass-locked drawers, each labeled in faded blue ink.<br /><br />"<em>Madon Caraginan</em>," read Mathia, sounding out the Lemurian letters on one label.<br /><br />"What's that?"<br /><br />"Who. Caraginan means warrior. Madon means sword.&#8221;<br /><br />Mathia spent every spare hour reading. Brand only needed to hear something once, so he never bothered with books. "So, <em>Madon Caraginan</em> is a sword warrior?"<br /><br />"A swordsman."<br /><br />Brand slid a metal rod through the thin hasp of the lock. <br /><br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; cried Mathia, but he yanked down and broke off the lock with a tiny ping. Brand still couldn't believe Mathia had gone along with this. And now, she was like always - no fun at all. He pulled open the drawer and slid out a vial of silver fluid.<br /><br />"Essence of swordsman," he said, grinning.<br /><br />"That can't be right," protested Mathia. "They wouldn&#8217;t do that to a person."<br /><br />"They did it to the squirrel." Brand tried to picture it. They must have human-sized vessels for denaturing people into meat, and bone, and spirit. "Pick another," he said.<br /><br />&#8220;You should stop,&#8221; said Mathia, but Brand just glared at her. She sighed, then carefully counted over three drawers and up two. "<em>Kanath Magdath</em>," she read quietly. "Black sorcerer."<br /><br />"Oh, yes," breathed Brand. He popped the lock, and drew out a black vial that froze his fingers one moment and burned them the next. "And they give us bird potions and puppies." He held it up to the light.<br /><br />&#8220;Don't take that,&#8221; said Mathia.<br /><br />"No," said a voice from a dark corner. &#8220;No, young Brand certainly should not take what is not his.&#8221; Mal Zabir stepped out of the shadows. "Give up the potion, boy. It is not for you.&#8221;<br /><br />Brand gulped and stepped back. &#8220;We just want to know,&#8221; he complained. "They never teach us everything. We want to learn!"<br /><br />"You'll learn nothing more from this school," said Professor Stark, striding into the room. "Very good, Mathia. There's one like him in every class. Master Zabir flushes them out every time." Mathia gave Brand a look filled with apology and moved away. Professor Stark stepped forward.<br /><br />Brand snatched a vial from his robe and shattered it on the floor. Brown gas bloomed up in a thick cloud. He looked up to the barred window, and shouted the Word of unlocking he&#8217;d heard that morning from Mal Zabir.<br /><br />"He's getting away!" coughed Mathia.<br /><br />Brand swallowed the last of his bird potion, spread his powerful wings and arrowed through the portal.<br /><br />"Let him go," said Mal Zabir. "I am certain he will not get far. Those labels are not real. That black potion he stole? You know your Lemurian, young lady. How would you translate <em>ghal kordathish</em>?"<br /><br />Mathia puzzled it through. "Essence of... granite?" <br /> <br />&#8220;Oh, quite," laughed Mal Zabir. &#8220;And one cannot change back from stone. Such an eager boy. We will look for him in the morning." <br /><br />On the ledge outside the window, an eagle-boy listened briefly, then launched himself into the wide, wild dark.<br />
