Ten minutes before they had been laughing and telling fart jokes while Jay dumped a bunch of liquids into a bucket, typical cleaners and solutions that every dad has in the garage for every possible eventuality. The plan was to just set some stuff on fire. </p><p>Jay liked fire and knew how to make the flames turn different colors by adding different stuff. As a result of this talent, his friends had started to call him “The Wizard.” Jay just wanted to set stuff on fire…if he had an audience that was just fine. </p><p>This time, Jay had thrown in some laundry detergent and other household cleaners. He had even found some old plant food from the garden. All ingredients for a fantastic fire show. </p><p>His friends, Zach and Jorge, watched in amazement as he had ceremoniously struck a match on the bottom of his sneakers and threw it in the bucket with proper wizard-like flourish. His brew produced a whoosh as it came alive in blue and green flames. </p><p>Zach and Jorge chanted, “Wiz-ard! Wiz-ard! Wiz-ard! Wiz-ard!” </p><p>Jay had then grabbed some metal shavings from his Dad’s scrap bin and threw them into the flames. Bright gold sparks shot through the multicolored flame.</p><p>That was when it had happened. </p><p>They had heard a strange tearing sound that seemed to come from all around them. The air above the metal bucket started to waver and stretch. A vertical slit of bright white light started to form and grew into a giant circle. A giant gust of wind extinguished their beautiful fire and then the whole garage had started to glow in an eerie blue-white light. </p><p>Now the boys watched in a mix of revulsion and captivation as four long, webbed fingers, then a bony wrist, followed by a long skinny bluish-white arm emerged from the circle. This was followed by a long skinny body with a giant head that held two huge black almond shaped eyes very close to a tiny nose. Quite abruptly, the circle disappeared and this strange blue being was left hovering in the air above them. </p><p>A shimmery metallic cloth clung to its slender body. It had no hair and they noticed that not just the fingers were webbed but also between each toe was what appeared to be a lacy webbing. </p><p>With arms out-stretched and head thrown back, the being spoke, “I am The Great Ethamrapap. Who is the wizard who summoned me with their strong magic and powerful potions?”</p><p>The boys blinked simultaneously. </p><p>“Your wizard sent for me.” Ethamrapap continued. “Where is the wizard?” </p><p>Zach and Jorge, finally finding their feet, scrambled behind Jay. </p><p>Ethamrapap gestured to Jay, “Are you the wizard?” There was a slight tone of disbelief behind the words this time.</p><p>“Uh…I’m…Uh…m-m-m-m-my…um…” Jay stammered. </p><p>“Yes! J-j-j-j-j-jay is the wizard!” Zach volunteered, pointing at Jay with both hands. </p><p>Ethamrapap’s color changed and seemed to shimmer for a brief second. </p><p>“Wait…what?” The creature blinked twice. “YOU…are the…wizard?” A strange sound emitted from the creature as it slapped itself in the forehead. </p><p>“Well. Shit.”</p><p>The boys nervously looked at each other and slightly shrugged their shoulders. </p><p>“Shit. Shit. Shit.” The creature gestured with its wrist and the eerie light was gone. In the now less than dramatic light of the garage, Ethamrapap appeared slightly greenish with flakey, scabby skin, and a weird bit of hair on his chin. The fancy metallic cloth that had draped his body fell to the floor and revealed old gray sweatpants with the ankle elastic shot and with what appeared to be Cheetos stains all over. </p><p>The boys gasped.</p><p>“What? You’ve never seen someone on their day off get called into work? I’m not dressing up for anyone on my day off…not even a “great wizard.” Ethamrapap did air quotes and then crossed his skinny arms across his scrawny chest. </p><p>Jay finally found his voice. “W-what are you doing here? W-who? What?”</p><p>“Settle down tiny Earth boy. First, I’m here because you little weirdoes summoned me, my name is really Vicram, and I’m an alien…duh.” The alien brushed a little at the sweatpants. “I was at home, in my sweatpants, eating Cheetos about to kick my brother’s ass at Halo thank you very much.” </p><p>“Um…uh…w-w-w-why would a wizard s-s-summon…you?” Jorge barely whispered.</p><p>“Ugh…don’t you kids read anymore? A wizard summons an alien to carry out spells and other special requests. It doesn’t pay that great but I get one hell of a discount on special effects.” Vicram flicked his wrist again and the light was instantly shimmering around them. “See? Ooooh….Ahhhh. Pretty lights!” The wrist flicked and the light was gone again. </p><p>“Dude.” Said Zach</p><p>“Dude.” Agreed Jorge</p><p>“Duuuuuude.” Concluded Jay.</p><p>“Soooo…anyway…” Vicram ran its thumb-like digits along the waistband of the sweatpants. “Since I’m here…anyone have a Code Red Mt. Dew?” His eyes rolled over to the Jeep parked next to them. “Hey now…this is awesome!” Vicram grabbed the keys off the wall and jumped in the vehicle. </p><p>“Look tiny humans, I don’t get paid to babysit so I’m gonna get back to it.” Vicram crashed the Jeep through the garage doors and burned rubber down the street. The boys sat in stunned silence, the smell of burned tires settling around them. </p><p>“Should we try it again?” Jay asked the guys.</p><p>“YEAH! This time let’s try for an ogre!” </p><p>THE END</p></div>
