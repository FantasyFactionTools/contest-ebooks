<div class="shortstory"><h1 id="story3">A Debt Paid</h1><h2 class="authorByline">By Feanor</h2><p> The wind blasted the coarse, rough sand upon Kitster penetrating his hood and cloak and adding to his irritation. The twin suns weren't helping either, scorching the land depriving the humidity from the air and giving him a cotton-mouth and lip blisters. Jabba had given him a loan to repay his debts by working for him and this was his final job. He didn't want to think what would Jabba do if he refused to work for him or if his life was more precious than the poor sod's that was about to be eaten alive. In fact he didn't want to think at all, he was tired and parched from walking in the Dune Sea. Jabba had instructed him to walk from his palace all the way to the Great Pit of Carkoon, which was no doubt, for his "benefit" as well. Well, he wasn't called the greatest gangster in the galaxy for nothing. "Majordomo,how far to the Pit?" Majordomo, some time ago he felt proud hearing the title, his dream in life, now it felt sarcastic and meaningless. Born as a slave he knew from a very young age that the greatest position a slave could ever acquire is Majordomo, a representative of a powerful individual or House. He managed to buy his freedom and then worked as a smuggler for a time. He met Nejj in one job and decided to take him under his wing as a protege. He eventually managed to become Majordomo of the Rendala Estate, a wealthy Mos Espa House. Only for the Estate to foreclose and leave him unemployed and in debt. Kitster let out an irritated sigh. "Nejj,how many times have I told you to not call me Majordomo?That is a thing of the past ." "Fine boss but you could have bargained a better deal with Jabba or at the very least we could have taken our airship" "Enough Nejj, I will not be judged in my dealings by a whelp."He looked ahead at the great hole in the Dune Sea. "We're here, bring the poor fella" The prisoner was gagged and bound and he was shaking with a terrified look on his face. Kitster reached for the mouth gag and removed it. The smuggler started coughing a mixture of sand and saliva. Kitster waited some seconds before asking him" Are you ready?" The smuggler looked at him with begging eyes "Please, I'll do anything" "You don't have anything to give me so I can't help you." He grabbed him and moved him right at the edge of the Great Pit. At that moment the wind ceased and a gurgling sound echoed in the sands. The smuggler started thrashing about trying to back away from the edge. "Hold him Nejj, stop shuddering damn you!" Nejj reluctantly grabbed him and together with Kitster they hold him in place. "Please,I can give you a silver ring that's all I have." "Nejj, search him." Nejj started patting him down. "Found it, it's a silver ring boss." "Hmmm... what do you know, it seems I can help you after all." "So you'll let me go?" His voice full of hope broke a little at the end of his sentence. "Haha, no my friend Jabba has marked you for death and that cannot be avoided but I can at least make it painless, without suffering." "How?"His voice barely a whisper. "Well,you're going into the Pit but you don't have to go in alive, except if you prefer 1000 years of agony." The smugglers face changed, hope and terror replaced by acceptance. "You know I had dreams." "Don't we all?" "I would make enough money to retire in a beautiful planet with the love of my life. Can you do me a favor?" "Depends on the favor." He reached with his bound hands and removed his handmade scarf. "Can you give this to my wife?" "If I can, where can I find her?" "She works as a serving girl in the arena, her name is Akiva." Kitster was startled. "In the Moss Espa Swoop Arena?" "Yeah, could you give it to her and tell her that I love her more than anything?" Kitster took the scarf with a thoughful look like he was deciding something. "It's a small world my friend.Don't worry I'll give it to her." "Thank you!" The smuggler visibly relaxed and closed his eyes."I'm ready" Kitster slowly removed his blaster from the holster and raised it pointing right at the smuglers heart. "See you at payday!" Kitster used the farewell phrase that smugglers say to each other before a dangerous job. He shoot his blaster right through the smugglers heart.The body fell through the hole right inside Carcoon's enormous mouth. The wind vengefully slapped them with a wave of sand. "Well, now that's done with, can we go boss?This place gives me the creeps." "Yeah, let's go back.Jabba will want confirmation." By the time they reached the palace the twin suns had give way to Tatooine's three moons. Just outside the palace a lone figure was waving at them. "Kit, Nejj you're here!" "Tamora what are you doing here?" Kitster's shock was obvious for his wife started laughing. "What, you're not the only that can surprise mister." "How did you..." "Ulda told me, I guess your ex-wife is more important than your present one since you bother to tell her where you're going." Ulda, damn her, still causing me trouble. "Tamora, Ulda knows only because she mediated with Jabba to give me the loan." "I know husband but she was so smug when she told me that she infuriated me." "Forget about her, Tamora we're free!I just finished the last job for Jabba." The look on Tamora's face was that of pure happiness. "At last husband, what was the last job?" Kitster's expression turned dark for a split second, almost unnoticeable and then he resumed his excited,happy face. "It doesn't matter Tamora,tell me something, do you know a serving girl named Akiva?" "Yeah, she's one of the youths at the arena, very happy girl, why?" Kitster took out the handmade scarf and passed it to his wife. "Give it to the girl and tell her he loved her more than anything." "What is this?" "It doesn't matter Tamora, please just do it." "Alright husband, I'll do it but we will talk after." "Yeah, we will talk, now can you leave? We're about to go in." "Okay,I'll see you at home." Kitster stood and watch her leave until her figure vanished in the night. "Come on Nejj, let's get this over with." He moved to the door, Nejj close behind. He knocked three times and one of Jabba's henchmen opened the sliding window. "It's me, I need to see Jabba." "The enforcer made a grumpling noise and closed the window.After a moment the huge trapdoor opened." "The job is done.Jabba said he wants personal confirmation, take us to him." He brought them to Jabba's court and he signaled Fortuna by Jabba to announce them. "Kitster Chanchani Banai and Nejj Varn" "So, tell me Kitster my boy was he still screaming when you left?" Jabba asked him with morbid anticipation. "Yes, Lord Jabba, he will suffer for the next 1000 years." "Good, he will be another example of what happens when you cross a Hutt." He laughed almost maniacally and pulled the chain in his hands to bring closer a young woman. The woman struggled futilely as Jabba licked her face. "Err...Lord Jabba, this was the third and final job, I believe our contract is ended." "Yes, yes Kit my boy, consider your debt paid.If you ever want another loan you can always work for me."Again that cold, maniacal laugh. "Thank you Lord Jabba, I will be taking my leave"Kitster couldn't wait to leave the palace. He hated Jabba and all he represented. He hoped someone would come that would end Jabba's tyranny in this land. "Boss, maybe we should start smuggling again." "Yeah, Nejj, maybe." He answered Nejj halfheartedly. As they reached their airship at the docks one fella had just landed and motioned them to stop. He was wearing a black cloak and a hood covered his face. "Esteemed gentlemen is this Jabba's palace?" Esteemed gentlemen, huh, if only he knew. "Yeah, but I don't advise you to go in stranger, nothing good can come out by associating with Jabba, if you value your life turn around." "Thank you friend but don't worry about me, you should worry about Jabba." There was something about the stranger that made Kitster believe what he said. "Aye, maybe it is so, good luck stranger!" "Luck to you too friend!" he said as he moved towards Jabbas palace. "Come on, Nejj, Tamora will be waiting for dinner." They boarded the old airship and left the blackness of the desert following the light of the city</p>.</div>
