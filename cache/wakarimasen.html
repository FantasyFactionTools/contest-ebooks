Merovech grabbed the tarnished rail with his spare hand and laughed. Scrabbling to find their footing, the two women scowled back.</p><p>"Oh come on!" He shouted above tortured groans of the ship. "You must see the irony here. We're all about to die over an elixir that promises eternal life."</p><p>Bracing her feet against an ornate girder, Jeren wobbled to a halt.</p><p>"Give us the flask, Merovech. This isn't the time for your insanity."</p><p>She checked her friend, crouched against another metal rib that vaulted the control room. </p><p>"Can you take him from there?"</p><p>Molia's hair spilled around her face, as red as the flames licking the outside of the glass bulkheads. She shook her head. Merovech tucked the steel flask into the sash at his waist.</p><p>"I love that you two are just as ruthless as I thought!" He grinned and pulled himself closer to the console. "It's just so..." He searched for the word with an excited shiver. "...diabolical!"</p><p>Somewhere, something very important exploded from its moorings and the whole ship rolled.The violent turn threw all three from their perches.</p><p>Molia caught the worst of the floor's reassignment to wall. She fell the shortest distance but with a sharp twist. She cracked her head against the girder and fell ragged, thought extinguished in a bloody instant. Jeren smacked into the glass beside her, scrabbling toward her friend as Merovech joined them with a whoop, landing heavily on his shoulder.</p><p>The assassin cradled her friend, ignoring the forest a thousand feet below. She tapped a bloody cheek and whispered the red head's name. Merovech dragged himself to them, eyes fixed on the sparking ruin of the console above. </p><p>"If that thing drops we're fucked." He looked down through the glass wall at the fast approaching ground. "Ah. Actually, we're properly fucked anyway. Nice job girls."</p><p>"Piss off Merovech. We never expected you to get airborne. This was supposed to blow before it got off the ground." Jeren did not turn from her friend.</p><p>"Typical. Even when I exceed expectations I still end up getting dropped in the shit." He looked thoughtfully down. "And this shit has a particularly high drop. Is she alright?"</p><p>The question caught Jeren off guard, finally turning her attention. </p><p>"What the fuck do you care?"</p><p>Merovech tutted, then shrugged.</p><p>"I don't. He does."</p><p>Jeren spat. "You fucking psycho. Which one is it now?"</p><p>"Me." Merovech's face softened, his brown eyes turning blue.</p><p>"The Monk? Oh that's just great." Jeren shook her head. "No offence, but you've never been much use to anyone."</p><p>"You are much like my companions in that regard. They too discount the usefulness of compassion. I doubt this will change their minds, but perhaps it may change yours."</p><p>Merovech pulled the canister from his waist and slid it along the glass, a mild smile spreading in his grey streaked beard. Jeren snatched at it with disbelief.</p><p>"I believe there is enough in there for two measures. I do not believe your partner will last long without hers. I doubt you will last much longer without the other." He looked significantly at the slowly spinning slopes.</p><p>Jeren hastily unscrewed the flask and lifted it to her friend. The other woman stirred immediately. Before Merovech could change his minds Jeren slugged back the rest of the flask and tossed it away.</p><p>"NO!" Merovech stood, eyes blazing to green. "You stupid bastard!"</p><p>Both women scampered back, pulling at weapons in their tunics. What remained of the ship rocked with another explosion, returning Merovech to his hands and knees. When he looked up, green had been replaced by brown and he was chuckling.</p><p>"Wow." He sat back, gobsmacked. "I'll never hear the end of that. I'm going to want to kill me for the rest of our days. Or day might be more accurate."</p><p>Neither woman relaxed their hands on hidden blades. Molia lent in to her friend.</p><p>"We need to jump. I don't know how good this stuff is, but I don't want to our first test to be dropping a hundred tons of skyship onto ourselves."</p><p>Merovech nodded. "She has a point Jeren. You'd best be quick. It's been a singular and somewhat final pleasure ladies." He tried to bow whilst sitting cross-legged.</p><p>The iron leaves and scrollwork that decorated the ship's visible skeleton provided plenty of purchase for keen climbers and none could be keener than the two women that were fleeing for their lives. Jenen had shot through the hatch toward the escape kite in seconds. Molia paused at its mouth and looked back at Merovech.</p><p>"Come with us."</p><p>"Ah, Mol. I don't think so." He waved his hand dismissively. "That kite is only meant for one so, as it is, you two are in for a heavy landing. Without the potion I'd never make it anyway."</p><p>He regarded her for a second, curled like a spooked forest fox about to dive for the safety of its den.</p><p>"Seriously. Go. You're forgiven. At least by me, but if you stick around much longer I can't guarantee I won't try and shoot you." He pulled a thick nosed pistol from it's holster and laid it on his lap. The red fox bolted.</p><p>Merovech sat calmly on the glass, watching the world turn in a way it should not. He tossed the gun aside and smiled.</p><p/><div align="center"><img src="images/wakarimasen-0.gif" alt="" class="bbc_img"/></div><p>Jenen watched the plume of smoke on the distant hill. The skyship had come down almost straight, not carving much of a gully to its grave. Unlike their escape kite, which had dragged them through a mile of branches, steadfastly refusing to break anything but their bones. She could feel her legs knitting together now, it tickled.</p><p>"He really was a mad bastard." Molia guessed her thoughts. </p><p>"Completely. I kind of liked him."</p><p>"Me too. Why do you think he did it?"</p><p>"Fuck knows. Like you say.... a mad bastard. At first I thought he had switched the flask, like he did with the necklace back in that casino."</p><p>Molia barked a laugh at the memory.</p><p>"Shit that was good. The look on that fat bitch's face."</p><p>"Yeah. It was nice getting one over on her for a change. Let's hope she thinks we all died in the ship. Then we won't have to keep looking over our shoulders."</p><p>"Mmmm. He didn't though. Switch it I mean." Molia was serious again.</p><p>"No he didn't."</p><p>The crashed skyship had failed to inflame the damp autumn forest, but it was still a mighty blaze. The two sat together as their bodies rejuvenated, watching the mechanical funeral pyre.</p><p>"Mad bastard." Jenen repeated.</p><p/><div align="center"><img src="images/wakarimasen-1.gif" alt="" class="bbc_img"/></div><p>If any forest foxes had been brave enough to inspect the edges of the twisted wreckage, they might have seen tendons striking like cobras at a burnt mound. Threads of bone fired like boarding lines then drew tight scattered pieces of corpse, thickening to their purpose before the cobras enclosed them. Gradually the shape of a man began to rise from the scorched floor. If that was not enough to set any creature to flight they may have heard his muttered conversation.</p><p>"The Abbot will not be happy with us, creating two more immortals.... </p><p>Screw him, he lost his sense of humour a dozen centuries ago, some of us still like to have a little fun.... </p><p>You call this fun? I swear, when we get out of this I'm going to find a bar and get so drunk you two fall asleep, then I'm going kick the shit out of someone.... </p><p>Well, I'm all in for the getting drunk part, after that you can do what you like....</p><p>Why harm the innocent? I am surprised that you do not approve of our rash actions....</p><p>Why would I....?</p><p>I think he means that those girls were good fun in the drunken punch up stakes. It's a bit of a shock you don't appreciate their ascendance....</p><p>I suppose. They were quite handy when we got cornered by the Duke's men. Yeah, I guess they could be fun to have a long for the ride...</p><p>It is a long ride, brother. All company becomes welcome eventually, during eternity....</p><p>That's why we keep ending up back at the temple....</p><p>Our next visit may be a while, as I say, the Abbot will not be happy with our choices....</p><p>And as I said, screw him. He sent us to close down the fountain and we did. He didn't say anything about destroying any elixir it might have already produced....</p><p>Probably thought we'd just destroy everything as usual. I would've if you'd given me a chance...</p><p>Good job we didn't then. Now... " </p><p>The figure trod uncertainly forward, testing new formed feet.</p><p>"...let's find that bar and get drunk."</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
