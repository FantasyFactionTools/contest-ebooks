Ere drawn was sword she clearly sang,</p><p>Of silver webs that bound them all, both noble lord and lady tall,</p><p>Encircling mighty crown and land in falsely fragile mind and hand.</p><p>The king and queen their captain shame, send slinking from their court like knave,</p><p>For drawing weapon threatening, then happy eyes watch maiden sing.</p><p>“And would this court so fair and wise, not profit from the loss of guise,</p><p>obscuring greater deeds and dreams that otherwise beyond you seem?”</p><p> </p><p>"What gifts have you to change this land?" asked silver bearded king his grand</p><p>and queenly wife upbraiding laughs, but darkling daughter shrugs "My draughts."</p><p>"Draughts?" queenly wizened matron frowns, and wrinkles smooths from well-worn gowns,</p><p>Once fair on shoulders smooth they hung. "Draughts - potions like I saw when young?"</p><p> </p><p>"Nay fair haired queen thou never saw, such potions peerless with no flaw,</p><p>Imbued with powers deep and strong, to limber limb and make life long.”</p><p> </p><p>"No powers these thy drinks command – my butcher's meats also make grand</p><p>The body's sinews, strength, and size, what other power in you lies?”</p><p> </p><p>"Great powers vast I summon for the sweetly dripping dews I pour,</p><p>‘Neath moonlit skies with thunderous dread to fill the vials blue and red,</p><p>With starlight caught on skein of silk, I weave the pearly drops like milk,</p><p>In glen remote ‘Neath heaven’s stairs, where neither man nor maiden fares.”</p><p>“O! Maiden fair we plainly see, great craft you wield and mightily,</p><p>Now plainly boons and gains do tell, so we might craven council quell.”</p><p> </p><p>"More deep the power I implore, than any else hast held before,</p><p>To quicken mind and senses hone, to give youth’s strength to anchor throne."</p><p>"Your price young maiden quickly say, what wicked thing desired to pay?"</p><p>“My single fee: to welcome me, as daughter of thy family,</p><p>When time has sped and from you fled, your crown shall rest upon my head.</p><p>The sole exception that be said, thy choice in husband I shall wed.</p><p>So fully joined our powers would, the land and kingdom do great good.”</p><p>Thus spoke the king in mighty voice, uplifting court his cry: “Rejoice!</p><p>Her price is but a second boon, to powers offered and right soon,</p><p>No heirs have come to ancient line, this maiden comes with offer fine,</p><p>No children ever here have roamed, small price is this: to grow our home!”</p><p>The darkling daughter potions brings, the red to queen, the blue to king,</p><p>Corks then to courtly floor they cast, a joyful look they share – one last.</p><p> </p><p>And drinking down the bitter draught, says maiden to the court “At last!</p><p>My bargain is complete you see, from poison strong they cannot flee, </p><p>For never should a land be ruled, by those so swiftly, surely fooled.</p><p>Bring Captain wise to me for groom, our wedding feast will now this room.”</p></div>
