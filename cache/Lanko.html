<div class="shortstory"><h1 id="story12">The Panther Spirit of the Swamp</h1><h2 class="authorByline">By Lanko</h2><p>From the trees I watch the pygmies creep through the bog mounted on their wattled cranes, their lanterns held in front of them like fishing poles.</p><p>Searching for me while the undead became another danger lurking in the flats required great courage, even though I was the one who lured them here, a safe area. A hunter doesn’t go to his prey’s nest, but hides and patiently waits until it enters his hunting ground. </p><p>One of them stopped and cast an inquisitive glance: “Is there something behind me?”, and then moved on, disturbed. </p><p>The mind may not notice and even lie to itself, but your spirit knows and tries to alert you. It’s the hunter’s greatest trick to make you ignore that warning; when you think you are really alone, yet feel the eyes of someone looking in on you. Never dismiss it as just the wind or your imagination. Because it’s not.</p><p>But now is not the time for hunting. Today I prepare the true hunting ground, for a great feast is coming. I jump, landing behind them. One of them falls from his wattled crane and the startled, riderless bird flees further into the marsh.</p><p>“Trespassing.”</p><p>“Panther Spirit,” one of them says, raising his arms. “Alliance. Witch.” He throws a small package in front of me. I shake my head. The other pygmy throws his. Silence. And the pygmy who fell from his mount throws a third offering.</p><p>“I will hear your chief.”</p><p>We proceed to their tribe, with me scouting ahead, no undead in our way. Their village is encircled by ankhs and altars, all of them preventing not only the undead from approaching it, but me as well. We walked along a path that led us to a hidden entrance, the dozens of altars and symbols actually all false in that area. I didn’t know this, and neither does the witch. </p><p>I’m not afraid of being trapped. They are more desperate than me.</p><p>The undead have been restless, surrounding them for most of the day, retreating only for brief intervals, where a few brave warriors go out to hunt. They think the witch needs to sleep and can’t control the undead all the time. It’s only partly true, but they don’t need to know the whole story.</p><p>We, mortal enemies, celebrated the alliance with a small feast, the pygmies slowly dancing in circles under the sound of drums and flutes; they looked like children playing. I preferred to watch their shadows on the walls, taller than their souls, contorting furiously as the flames moved.</p><p>What for them is a demonstration of union and strength, for me shows only weakness. Walls and huts means permanence, other predators now know where you are. Trophies and treasure makes you too proud and careless. Commitment to others will drag you down. But I believe is too much for the humans to live in silence and isolation, only with the freedom of body and mind to survive under the wandering stars and the whispering wind, adapting to the unknown.</p><p>They gave me an ankh, supposedly to protect me from the witch’s sorcery. The undead returned, surrounding the tribe, their moaning an ululation of despair. Two of them approached the gates and placed a spear on the ground.</p><p>The witch wants to see me.</p><p>The Zebra Spirit ignored her and was hunted down for being impolite. The Hippo Spirit went and became dinner for the undead. So it would be ill-mannered to decline the invitation and ill-advised to accept it.</p><p>But a hunter doesn’t run, and sometimes you do have to go right into your prey’s nest. She lived in a cave by the lake. I could never approach this place without the pygmy trinket. And they couldn’t come here to kill her because of the marsh and it’s poisonous flora filling the ground, water and air.</p><p>Not the first time I saw her, and I also know her true nature, but it still unsettled me seeing her sitting cross-legged, her raven hair and dark liquored eyes and skin untouched by the dirt or the smell of the swamp.</p><p>“The Panther Spirit. I saw you in the pygmy’s tribe.”</p><p>“They offered me an alliance to kill you.” Unlike the other two Spirits of the swamp, I am direct. She stood immediately and the undead surrounded me.</p><p>“And you think you can do it alone?”</p><p>I closed my eyes, inhaling slowly. “Alone? I am the Panther Spirit. I reign over this place. I hear the swamp, the wood and the lake talk; insects and birds singing; the scent of soil and beast; all breathing life into the animal hidden within me.” I looked at her and smiled. “My dear lady, make no mistake. I’m by myself, but I am not alone. Your undead can’t kill me.” A total lie, of course.</p><p>She laughed. “Zombies don’t kill. They recruit for their cause. But I prefer my cats with shining fur instead of rotting flesh.” She sat again. “Why did you come then?”</p><p>“I have no sympathies for the pygmies. Always contesting my preys. Tell me why you are so eager to destroy them and we can be allies.”</p><p>“Our government wants a dam in this region. I came to prevent it. The consequences for the biodiversity here would be devastating. One day I got lost, left my car to get a better signal for my phone and… I… I died. I don’t even know how it happened. It took me awhile to realize it, even seeing my corpse in front of me. The pygmies came and carried it inside their village, chopped me to pieces and put me in their cauldrons and… and… I will have my revenge!”</p><p>I didn’t understand half of what she said. The undead screamed with her. They also wanted their vengeance, and I saw it in their eyes, staring at me. They see me. They feel it. They know. But they can’t do anything unless she says so.</p><p>“They also want their revenge,” she said.</p><p>“There’s a hidden passage to the tribe unguarded. Attack tomorrow. I will trick them.” I removed the amulet the pygmy chief gave me and offered it to her. “Use this. A gift from me, the protection of the Panther Spirit. They won’t be able to harm you.”</p><p>She reluctantly picked the ankh. “Tomorrow then.”</p><p> </p><p>“Witch is dead?” asked the pygmy chief.</p><p>“She will come in two days. With me here, her spells won’t work. Prepare yourselves.”</p><p>Tired from the celebrations, they went to sleep, only to awake in the morning to the screams and the echoing gong of the alarm. The undead carried torches, putting the tribe aflame and then blocked all exits. The pygmies, dazed and panicked, and too short to escalate their own walls, were cornered and surrounded by the fire.</p><p>The witch observed all this from outside, delirious in joy. </p><p>From a tree, I stared at the pygmy chief, giving him my most feline smile. Nothing more delicious to repay betrayal with betrayal. He stared back with pure hatred, and screamed magical words before the inferno swallowed him.</p><p>The witch also screamed, as the trinket I gave her shattered and lightning engulfed her. The undead stopped, falling motionless on the ground. The witch stared at her hands, the pygmy spell slowly causing her to fade. She ran away.</p><p>I jolted after her. It’s hard to chase spirits, but she was still too attached to her worldly feelings and desires. So she didn’t float above the marshes, didn’t pass through trees and raised her hands to protect her face from vines and branches that wouldn’t touch her. We ran, the fog getting more and more thick, but I’m used to this endless grey. We arrived at a familiar site, where a metal mount of those building the great wall of stone was half drowned into the bog.</p><p>The place where she died. </p><p>Intuition? Last memories while still alive? A familiar place, perhaps, as even ghosts need a sanctuary. </p><p>“It’s a bit ironic,” I said, approaching her slowly. “You didn’t want the great wall on the river built, but cornered the pygmies in their own tribe and killed the other two spirits of the swamp, thus leaving the outsiders undisturbed. But fear not. Now that the pygmies and the other two spirits are gone, the flats are mine alone to reign and that will soon change. If it’s a consolation.”</p><p>She looked at me, then her eyes went wide with realization. Hopefully remembering the moments before her death and the pygmies.</p><p>“You gave me quite the trouble these past months. My body needs flesh, but my spirit requires a bit more than that. Now I will finish what I started.”</p><p>So I caught her in my whisper, and as it happens with all my preys, her soul struggled against mine with a ruthless cry, but my ears heard only the silence so loud.</p></div>
