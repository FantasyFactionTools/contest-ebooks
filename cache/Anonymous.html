Even though it had his name on it.</p><p>He puttered about a draughty guest-room high up in the castle's southern tower, sweeping the floor without using a lick of sorcery. Hiding who—and what—he was. Even though she had clearly found out he was here.</p><p>A voice disturbed the quiet, its timbre like a ringing chime. "The cake won't kill you."</p><p>Icewind rolled his eyes and continued sweeping.</p><p>"There's nothing wrong with it. Even I can tell."</p><p>"Since when are you the expert?"</p><p>"Cakes need to be cut."</p><p>The wizard glared at his sword. "Cakes are cut <em>by knives.</em>"</p><p>Brightedge sent him a sharp look. "Don't be prejudiced. Swords are meant to cut too."</p><p>"Swords are meant to cut <em>people.</em>"</p><p>"You know how I feel about violence. It never solves anything."</p><p>Icewind groaned. "And I paid extra to get a bloody sword that could <em>turn my enemies into mincemeat.</em>"</p><p>"You never complain about that at dinnertime."</p><p>"That's different. You can't always moonlight as a piece of cutlery."</p><p>"You're one to talk! A wizard who works as a maid!"</p><p>The wizard turned bright red. "The correct term is <em>manservant.</em>" He put down the broom and fiddled with some knick-knacks on a shelf.</p><p>"Ah. I suppose that makes all the difference."</p><p>"I had to get away from her. "</p><p>"Well now you've been found out."</p><p>Icewind grimaced.</p><p>"Maybe she wants you back? She did send cake."</p><p>"We didn't part on the best of terms."</p><p>"I thought she was nice. That's all I'm saying."</p><p>The wizard laughed. "For a sword, you're remarkably trusting."</p><p>"We can't all have hearts as hard as steel."</p><p>Icewind sighed. Loudly.</p><p>"I may not be the sharpest, but I know there's more to it."</p><p>The wizard held his tongue. He opened a window to let the room air out and started dusting the sills. A servant's life of simple tasks and sedate routine did wonders for one's temper—and all the work was great for one's physique.</p><p>"At least let's cut one piece."</p><p>He shot a dirty look at the cursed cake. "I don't want it."</p><p>"It's a nice gesture!"</p><p>"It's a taunt. She knows I can't eat desserts."</p><p>"What's the worst that could happen?"</p><p>"You don't get a figure like mine if you eat cake."</p><p>"You never used to care."</p><p>"I never used to look like this."</p><p>"Indeed. You used to wear a wizard's robe."</p><p>Icewind gritted his teeth. "Cut it out. Or I'll throw you out the window. And that damn cake with you."</p><p>Brightedge glistened menacingly.</p><p>"That doesn't work on me. I know you."</p><p>The sword grumbled to itself.</p><p>The wizard finished off the windowsills and started folding the clothes which had been left strewn across the furniture.</p><p>"I bet that icing's nice and smooth."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Just one piece!"</p><p>"Every last crumb is filled with spells. I can't even tell what half of them are meant to do."</p><p>"I don't understand."</p><p>"She's a witch. It's what she does." Icewind pointed at the cake. "That thing probably causes an incurable addiction to sugar."</p><p>"Surely cooking is magical enough without adding sorcery into the mix."</p><p>"Only if all you want is food."</p><p>"And she wants something else?"</p><p>"Of course! She wants me to be like her. Fat and ugly."</p><p>"That's hardly fair."</p><p>"So now you're the judge of human beauty?"</p><p>"I have a keen sense of aesthetics. I am a work of art myself, you know."</p><p>Icewind closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He tried to picture the frost glittering beneath the stars, to feel the biting chill of the wind. To remember the clean simplicity of a solitary life.</p><p>"The cake is pretty too, you know."</p><p>He could almost feel the wilderness, the only place he felt at home. He'd lead that life again someday. If he could get away from her.</p><p>"I think it looks nice, at least."</p><p>He couldn't tune out Brightedge's voice. Visions of his long-lost life melted away. Reality alone remained—solid, heavy, inescapable. A dusty castle. A stupid sword. Chores. He gritted his teeth, opened a chest, and began to place the clothes inside.</p><p>"I wonder what the layers look like."</p><p>"I said no."</p><p>"It's just a cake."</p><p>The wizard took a deep breath. "Stop it."</p><p>"No need to get your knickers in a twist."</p><p>"I already told you no."</p><p>"I'd like to lodge a formal complaint."</p><p>"Shut up."</p><p>"You never let me be myself."</p><p>Icewind slammed the chest lid shut.</p><p>"You just want me to cut people. You barely let me help you with your food."</p><p>"You're a <em>sword.</em>"</p><p>"You never think about what <em>I</em> want."</p><p>"Don't be absurd."</p><p>"If this is going to work, you need to think about me too. Let me live a fulfilling life."</p><p>The wizard gripped his hair with shaking hands.</p><p>"We have to be a team. Not a master and an object."</p><p>"You're insane."</p><p>"So, I'll tell you one last time."</p><p>"Don't."</p><p>"I want to cut the cake."</p><p>Icewind roared and threw his hands up in the air; the very light seemed to tremble in fear. He yelled out words which sparked and fizzled as they came into the world, shaped them with flicking fingers and rolling wrists, directed them with an imperious sweep of his arm.</p><p>The cake flew out the window.</p><p>"Well that was very mature."</p><p>The wizard turned his furious gaze towards his sword. He raised his hands once more.</p><p>A deafening boom rent the air before he could utter one more word; the tower trembled, sending objects crashing from the shelves, then settled into a very disconcerting sway.</p><p>Dust filled the room. Icewind coughed. "What the hell was that?"</p><p>"That wasn't you?"</p><p>"Of course it bloody wasn't!" He hurried over to the window and stuck his head out.</p><p>A column of smoke rose from the ground at the base of the tower a hundred feet below. Soldiers rushed towards the scene, but nobody was nearby. Debris lay scattered across the lawns—rocks, churned earth, bits of wood.</p><p>Icewind was certain he could see some bright pink chunks of cake.</p></div>
