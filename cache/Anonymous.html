Just a little further and they'd be close enough. He stopped when he could see the headframe, standing proud over the huddled buildings and the empty courtyard.</p><p>John squeezed past him, dark eyes intent on their goal. "Are they gone yet?"</p><p>August shook his head. "What if they catch us?"</p><p>"It won't take long. I know where I need to go."</p><p>August shivered, despite the oppressive heat. "Can't we just ask?"</p><p>"They wouldn't listen."</p><p>"But my da—"</p><p><em>"No.</em> I have to do this." John glared at him. "I didn't ask you to come."</p><p>August looked away, silent. He didn't have a choice. He couldn't let his friend do this alone.</p><p>John snorted, then leaned forwards and craned his neck. "They're leaving."</p><p>"All of them?" August squinted and tried to count the adults as they left the mine.</p><p>"Would any of them miss the ceremony?"</p><p>"I don't get it. It's just a school."</p><p>John shrugged. "At least they're distracted."</p><p>The moment the adults were gone the boys broke cover, racing to the colliery entrance. Inside, the heat wasn't so unbearable, and the darkness was a balm to August's strained eyes. At least, it was until he saw it.</p><p>The shaft was a black hole in the middle of the room—an empty maw that oozed malevolence. His stomach twisted at the sight, and he took an instinctive step backwards.</p><p>John didn't seem to notice his distress. The older boy cast wary glances towards the shadowed corners of the room as he approached the pit.</p><p>August gritted his teeth. He had been down there once before, and he had lived. He shouldn't be scared—it hadn't been that bad. Not until he started seeing things at least, and that would <em>not</em> happen again. He wasn't crazy. Besides, up until a few years ago, <em>all</em> kids went down the mines to help—John had worked the traps for years.</p><p>Unable to tear his eyes from the yawning pit of darkness, he forced himself to move. The pit grew; the darkness deepened. Almost at its edge, swaying slightly, he steadied himself against a table. He had to do something about that evil darkness. He reached a trembling hand towards one of the davy lamps the miners had left on the table.</p><p>John reached it first, calmly picked it up, and lit the wick. "Look. You should stay here."</p><p>August nearly collapsed with relief. "You sure?"</p><p>John nodded and strolled over to the chains suspended over the shaft. "I won't be long." He strapped himself into the harness, then hesitated. He glanced at August, then looked away. "If anything happens… Thanks." Without looking up, he descended into the pit.</p><p>The lamplight faded into the depths. The rhythmic clatter of the chains was a lifeline in the dark, a thread that told him he was not alone.</p><p>August couldn't keep his gaze away from the pit. He lit another lamp and hung it in the opening—anything to fight back the shadows.</p><p>He waited, nervously glancing around the room. His gaze never strayed for long.</p><p>The chains stopped. Silence.</p><p>Seconds stretched to minutes. The only sound was August's breathing, fast and getting faster. His pulse started pounding in his ears. The world seemed to contract, swallowed whole by the vast and endless shadows that lurked in the abyss, until the last things left were the boy, his laboured breath, and the weak light that stood between him and the darkness.</p><p>The lantern wavered, flickered, then went out.</p><p>August's heart thundered, and he shakily edged away from the pit. He was halfway to the door before he could breathe and think again. The miners must not have filled their lamps before they went, and he must have used up the last of what was left in the one he chose. No reason to be afraid. Still, he took a fresh lamp from the cupboard by the door and made sure it was filled. When the lamp was merrily burning he ventured back to his pit-side vigil.</p><p>Shadows safely chained once more, he paced and fidgeted. Surely John should be back by now? The mines weren't <em>that</em> deep. But the chains remained silent. A thought struck him, and he froze in horror.</p><p>What if John's lantern had run out as well?</p><p>He would be deep within the earth, alone, with no light to guide his way. Lost. Begging for help. And there was only one person here to answer his call.</p><p>The rest of the village would be no help; the new school's opening ceremony would go on for hours. August could run and get someone, but then they'd be in real trouble. Besides, he didn't know for sure that John <em>was</em> in danger! No. He only had one option. And if it scared him shitless then it was his own damn fault.</p><p>He rolled his sleeves up and faced his nemesis. The lamp lit just the first few feet; the dark beneath was an endless chasm, willing him to fall. Dizzied, he swayed a little, but with a burst of anger he steeled himself, leaned out, and grabbed the chain. He pressed the cool metal against his forehead for a minute to let the world stop spinning.</p><p>Panic calmed, pulse still racing, he hauled the chain until the harness reappeared. Before he had a chance to listen to his doubts, he grabbed the lamp, strapped himself in, and started to descend. Within moments the mouth of the pit faded into shadows.</p><p>The clatter of the chains sounded different here, and no longer gave him comfort. The sphere of light felt far too small. The weight of earth above seemed to press down on him; his chest began to hurt.</p><p>It took all his focus just to move one hand over the other, to keep the harness moving. The world blurred, faded; something within him came apart and suddenly he could feel the earth around him. Just like last time.</p><p>A smoky darkness flowed through the rocks and earth, filled with a brooding power which hungered for the spark of life. Tiny cracks and fissures ran deep into its heart, each filled with a slick and oily fire. August could <em>feel</em> it. It echoed the rapid throb of blood through his veins, called to him like nothing else. He tried to fight his rising terror, but the world began to crack and groan as it responded to his fear.</p><p>It was happening again. But this time, he knew more. The veins of darkness in the earth were <em>coal</em>, the lifeblood of the world. The thing that lurked within its cracks was a gas: firedamp, a hazard feared by every miner. Exposed to flames, it could explode at any moment.</p><p>Understanding calmed his fear, and his heartbeat slowed once more. The firedamp settled down as well. August hesitated. Maybe he <em>was</em> crazy. Gases do not respond to emotion.</p><p>He crushed his wish to be as far away as possible, and carried on into the dark. With his newfound senses he could feel the jagged shape of the mine, a gnawing wound that would not close. He cast his thoughts out through the shafts and passageways, searching for anything that would hint at where John would be.</p><p>A short distance into a half-collapsed drift, not too far below him, a slight vibration seemed to be just what he hoped for. He worked his way down to the opening and hooked the harness to a bracket in the wall. He paused, reluctant, wishing he could leave. He took a deep breath. He had made it this far; he could finish this.</p><p>Half a dozen paces into the tunnel, he found a discarded lamp—still a little warm. He called out. The echoes lingered, almost masking the faint reply that came from further in. Careful not to trip over the tracks, he hurried deeper into the drift. Finally, he found his friend.</p><p>John crouched by a spill of rubble which completely blocked the tunnel. His sweaty hair was plastered over his forehead, his clothes and face were black with dust. His voice wavered, uncharacteristically high. "August? Is that you?"</p><p>"Yeah. You okay?"</p><p>John sighed, relief flooding his face. "Twisted my ankle. Tripped when my lamp went out."</p><p>"Yeah, mine went out too."</p><p>"I wondered how you knew."</p><p>"Shall we…" August frowned. "Why did you come over here?"</p><p>John tensed, staring at the floor.</p><p>"Oh." August's stomach dropped. John hadn't been an orphan for long, and of course an empty grave was not the same. This was where it had happened. A patch of dirt at John's feet caught his eye—a tiny grave, freshly broken.</p><p>A fluffy ear stuck out from the earth.</p><p>John bent down and tenderly reshaped the mound, until the bear was buried. He wiped away his tears, and set off towards the shaft without a word.</p><p> </p><hr/><h3>Original Source</h3>

<p>Nedderton is a village in Northumberland, England about 5 miles (8 km) southeast of Morpeth, just off the A192 road.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>In the early part of the nineteenth century Nedderton village was described as containing ten houses, a few cottages and a colliery. A Church of England school was built in 1846, funded by the Earl of Carlisle, though it seems many of the children preferred to attend Bedlington or Scotland Gate where the schools were non-denominational. The village also had both Primitive and Wesleyan Methodist chapels.</p>
<h4>Geography</h4>
<p>The soil in this area consists of clay with a subsoil of freestone. Chief among crops produced at the beginning of the twentieth century were wheat, oats, turnip and potatoes.</p>
<h4>Economy</h4>
<p>Nedderton Colliery was one of the oldest in the Bedlington area; it was sunk in 1818. The Howard West Hartley Coal Company leased the royalty from the Earl of Carlisle. Production increased through the nineteenth century, with around 280 to 300 hewers working and an output of 680 to 700 tons a day. By 1877 however it was no longer viable and the colliery closed. The site was taken over and again a pit was sunk, with coal being drawn by 1888. Nedderton Hall Pit was the last pit to be opened in Bedlingtonshire. It was first owned by a Mr. Wood, but by 1901 had been taken on by the Nedderton Coal Company. The pit was worked until 1943. It was closed during World War II by the Coal Commission, who could not justify the manpower used to keep it running during the war.</p></div>
