<br/><strong>Penelope and the Book Trolls</strong><br/><br/><br/>"Where is it?!" Penelope searched her shelves again. <strong>The Miller's Tale</strong> wasn't a valuable book, but the young Librarian worried that any book in her wing of the Endless Library could be missing, especially from her private office. Her Librarian's amulet told her the location of the collection's every book, scroll, and artifact, except for the dark, vile ones guarded by battle beetles in the deepest catacombs. She could locate books beyond the Library, too, if she stepped outside the massive walls.<br/><br/>"I sent three teams of shelf squirrels to search the stacks." Penelope's best friend and unofficial assistant, Alexander, leaned in her office doorway. Two of the magical squirrels that retrieved and re-shelved the Library's books perched on his shoulders.<br/><br/>Penelope fingered the amulet. The heavy seal was her badge of office, and magically connected her to the great Card Catalog. She lifted the golden chain from around her neck. Losing her link to the Library was like losing a piece of her soul.<br/><br/>"Here," she said, holding the amulet out to Alexander. "I have a meeting with the other Librarians - though they never listen to me, so I might as well not be there - then office hours. I can't leave the Library today, but you can."<br/><br/>Alexander's eyes lit up. He'd only been Outside a few times. Raised by the Library squirrels, Alexander had wandered the maze-like halls in bare feet and rags until Penelope came into his life two years before. <br/><br/>"Can I take the Overdue Collection squad?" he begged.<br/><br/>Penelope nodded. "Just be careful." Alexander gave her a cocky wave and ran off.<br/><br/>.....<br/><br/>The Endless Library stood at the nexus of the twelve known worlds, dedicated to collecting and protecting their knowledge. Since folk could cross to other worlds by passing through the Library, the Librarians controlled who paid how much to go where with what. Their currency was, of course, books. Millions and millions of books, even the annoyingly bad self-published ones. Want to borrow a book? Pay with a book. Want to sell wine from Chittar to Nard? Pay your passage with a book. The rarer and more magical your offering, the more valuable it was.<br/><br/>Books meant money, and where there's money, there's those who'll lie, cheat, and steal to get it. The Librarians called them "trolls", though most were normal folk.<br/><br/>Mort and Gord were book trolls. They didn't make much of a living, but they liked having the things around for their musty smell and the smooth touch of worn leather. They'd even read a few.<br/><br/>The husbands stared at the book in the center of their table, a thin volume with blue buckskin covers and only thirty-or-so pages.<br/><br/>"Tell me again, dearest," said Gord.<br/><br/>"See that symbol on the spine?" Mort pulled at the edges of his mustache nervously. "This here book is from Calabria, or I'm no scholar."<br/><br/>"Calabria," Gord breathed. "The lost world."<br/><br/>"This one's not for us, Gordy." It was only a children's book, but the boss wanted it enough that the two trolls had hired their best thief. Mort had paid the man off an hour before. "I'll go to Lady Tiger's tomorrow. She'll turn us into mincemeat if we fail her."<br/><br/>"Will she pay us well, Mort?"<br/><br/>Mort started to answer when the door to their little apartment burst open, slamming into the wall and rattling their few pieces of kitchenware. Mort grabbed a heavy club and shielded Gord as a figure stepped into the flickering candle light.<br/><br/>"It's a kid!" squeaked Gord. <br/><br/>In the threshold stood a boy in his early teens. He had a sharp, handsome face split by a wild grin. With slow drama, he pointed at the blue book. "That book belongs to the Endless Library."<br/><br/>"Oh, yeah?" Mort smacked the club against one palm. <br/><br/>"And it's overdue!" The boy's grin grew wider. <br/><br/>Mort stepped forward. "Who's gonna make us return it? You?"<br/><br/>"No!" The boy pointed at the window. "They are!" Ten squirrels in leather armor leaped through the open shutters, barking and brandishing tiny swords. Mort and Gord couldn't stop themselves screaming.<br/><br/>.......<br/><br/>A note appeared the day after Alexander rescued the missing book. Penelope thought the matter was finished until she found the cream-colored envelope placed in the exact center of her desk. She couldn't imagine how the thief kept getting into her office. This worried her as much as the contents of the letter itself.<br/><br/>"Honorable Librarian," the message began in neat script. "Please accept this invitation to dine with us tomorrow evening.&#8221; The handwriting in the next sentence changed, twisted. "You have something of ours and we want it back. Bring the book." The note was signed 'Lady Tiger' twice, once in each hand, along with a street address.<br/><br/><em>Something of mine.</em> <strong>The Miller's Tale</strong> belonged to the <em>Library</em>, not a criminal who paid for it to be stolen for her. Penelope had done her research. Lady Tiger was the self-proclaimed queen of the book trolls, a ruthless and unpredictable wizard who bossed the used book sellers, flim-flam men, and petty thieves of the city.<br/><br/>Their book, indeed. Penelope's blood boiled. Though she did wonder what might be for dinner.<br/><br/>.....<br/><br/>Penelope tucked the <strong>Tale</strong> into a fold of her robes, and summoned a carriage. She placed a small metal box next to the book. She hoped she wouldn't need to open it. She told herself she needed to understand anything that endangered the books, but, mostly she was curious about what made this little book important.<br/><br/>The carriage let her out at a sprawling brick house brightly lit against the night. A silent maid guided her to a room at the end of a long corridor. Books of every size, shape, and material lined the walls. Penelope found herself trying to read the spines.<br/><br/>Wrapped in gold and black striped silk, Penelope's hostess waited for her in a throne-like chair. Light from a candelabra cast strange shadows on the woman&#8217;s face.<br/><br/>"Welcome, my dear, dear Librarian," the woman said. "I hope you had a pleasant journey." Half her mouth moved, and half her face smiled. The other half snapped out, "Did you bring my book, girl? Youngest Librarian ever. Pah!"<br/><br/>The sudden shift from courtesy to rudeness was confusing. Penelope wondered which side of the face to answer. She decided on both.<br/><br/>'Thank you," she said. "The ride was quite pleasant." Then she added, "Yes, I brought the Library book you stole, but not to just hand it over to <em>you</em>."<br/><br/>&#8220;You see?" The polite side of the face was pleased. Penelope decided to call that one the Lady, and the other side the Tiger. "The young lady brought our book," Lady continued.<br/><br/>"Give it to us," demanded Tiger. One wrinkled hand stretched out, groping. Penelope shrank back.<br/><br/>She steadied herself, heart thudding. "This book was entered into the Card Catalog one hundred eighty-five years ago as bond for borrowing five books on knitting with basilisk bones. The borrower never returned them, so <strong>The Miller's Tale</strong> was forfeited as payment."<br/><br/>"That was my sister's doing," said Lady. "I always hated her," muttered Tiger.<br/><br/>Something Penelope read recently came to her. "You're a Calabrian gemini." They were rarer than rare now that the doors to that lost world were closed forever.<br/><br/>"Of course, you twit," spat Tiger. "What else would we be?"<br/><br/>Penelope sat without begging her hostess's leave. Lady tutted, and Tiger glared. The woman was a refugee, even if she was a criminal. Penelope drew out the <strong>Tale</strong> and rested it on her lap. Both sides of the troll queen tensed.<br/><br/>"You might have asked to trade for this.&#8221; Penelope flipped open the front cover and paged through the first few sheets. On the third, a childish hand had scrawled her name twice in different scripts.<br/><br/>"We trade for many things," said Lady. "But we take what's ours," Tiger sneered. "That's our way."<br/><br/>"Not with <em>this</em> Librarian," Penelope declared, then blushed a bit at her own pride. She consulted her amulet. "You have twenty-three overdue Library books in this house." Lady Tiger hissed. The amulet searched, sifted, and tallied again. "Plus three hundred seventeen in places around the city. Should I collect them all tonight?" She was bluffing, since she only had one squad of armored squirrels. Her stomach churned.<br/><br/>Lady Tiger said nothing, the two halves warring silently. At last her face smoothed into a careful smile. "Dinner will be ready soon," said Lady's voice. "I'm sure we can work something out." <br/><br/>Penelope let out a breath. She was very glad she wouldn't have to release a battalion of angry battle beetles from the metal box secreted in her robe. Trolls were a problem, but she didn't need a war. It looked now like everything would work out fine.<br/><br/>"Ever tried scorpion stew?" cackled Tiger. <br/><br/>Penelope's stomach clenched. She pasted a smile on her face. "Scorpion stew sounds lovely."<br/>
