<br/>&#8220;So, here&#8217;s a question,&#8221; Mateo said, hands raised. &#8220;What if I don&#8217;t <em>want</em> to get shot?&#8221;<br/><br/>Jansen settled his pistol on the counter between them. Mateo couldn&#8217;t be older than twenty, but Cordoba hired them young. Easier to control. Jansen was more than twice this kid&#8217;s age, but that&#8217;s what happened when you were good at your job. You got old.<br/><br/>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the thing, kid,&#8221; Jansen said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want it to look like you gave up.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;But I am giving up.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Right, and we appreciate that. But I don&#8217;t think your boss will, so here we are.&#8221;<br/><br/>The interior of one of Anton Cordoba&#8217;s run-down pawn shops smelled like old carpet, and kitschy knick knacks and outdated tech lined the dusty shelves. Nothing anyone would want, but that was the point &#8212; you didn&#8217;t want your fronts attracting actual customers. At least the windows were reflective.<br/><br/>Jansen&#8217;s newest partner, a slightly psychotic young enforcer named Tyler Ryke, unleashed a heavy sigh. &#8220;If he&#8217;s gonna&#8217; be a pussy about it, pop him in the arm. He&#8217;ll take hours to bleed out.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;What if you just knocked me out and tied me up?&#8221; Mateo asked. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be convincing?&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;That implies we got close enough to punch you,&#8221; Jansen said, &#8220;which isn&#8217;t a good look for anyone. Cordoba might still blame you for the theft.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Right.&#8221; Mateo clucked his tongue. &#8220;But maybe you could just shoot my gun, like you shot it out of my hand?&#8221;<br/><br/>Ryke pulled his pistol and pointed it at Mateo&#8217;s head. &#8220;How about I put a bullet in your brainpan right now? Won&#8217;t hurt a bit!&#8221;<br/><br/>Jansen lowered Ryke&#8217;s pistol with gentle pressure on the other man&#8217;s wrist and smiled at Mateo, who had just gone extraordinarily pale. &#8220;We don&#8217;t need a murder here, kid. That makes things messy, and the boss doesn&#8217;t appreciate messy.&#8221; He directed those words at Mateo, but they were actually for Ryke.<br/><br/>Ryke lowered his gun. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t have the stomach for this job, old man, maybe you should retire.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;The arm,&#8221; Mateo said suddenly. &#8220;I can take one in the arm.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Good call.&#8221; Jansen put a round through Mateo&#8217;s arm, just below the shoulder, which dropped the kid and left him howling bloody murder. Someone had obviously never been shot before. If Cordoba bought Mateo&#8217;s story about a gun fight, the kid might even get a new tattoo for his bravery.<br/><br/>Jansen offered Mateo&#8217;s surrendered gun to Ryke. &#8220;Shoot up the place while I&#8217;m in the vault. Leave the windows.&#8221;<br/><br/>Ryle holstered his own pistol and took Mateo&#8217;s, jaw clenched. &#8220;Why all this trouble for this little shit?&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Shoot the shelves, not the windows.&#8221; Jansen holstered his own gun. &#8220;Back in five.&#8221; He walked past the counter and the whimpering Mateo bleeding behind it.<br/><br/>As Jansen entered the vault room, loud reports and exploding electronics assured him Ryke was occupied. As frustrating as Ryke was, sadists had their uses, such as torturing the vault combination out of Cordoba&#8217;s accountant, &#8220;<em>El Gato Blanco</em>.&#8221; The pudgy white man&#8217;s real name was Walter Nelson.<br/><br/>Nelson now had twelve broken bones and a two missing fingers, but he was alive, thanks to Jansen. Ryke enjoyed his work just a bit too much, but Nelson must have known what might happen when he helped Cordoba rip off Ralyn Paran: Jansen&#8217;s boss, and the most powerful crime lord on the planet.<br/><br/>Jansen punched in the combo Ryke had pummeled out of Nelson, then breathed out when the vault door opened. That was the nice thing about money men, like Nelson. They understood the cost of loyalty didn&#8217;t equal the expense of being pummeled to death by steel knuckles. The shelves in this air-conditioned vault were stuffed wall to wall with packets of rocket dust, Paran&#8217;s newest and most addictive emotional drug.<br/><br/>Jansen pulled six packets from the dozens on the shelves, tucked them into his duffel bag, and zipped it up. As he turned to leave, he found Ryke standing behind him, staring into the vault with wide eyes. It would be nice to have a partner who followed orders, just once.<br/><br/>Ryke whistled to himself. &#8220;There&#8217;s gotta&#8217; be ten million in dust in here."<br/><br/>&#8220;Who&#8217;s watching Mateo?&#8221; Jansen asked. He didn&#8217;t need Ryke getting any ideas about taking a little on the side. Paran would blame him, not Ryke, since he&#8217;d been assigned to teach the new guy.<br/><br/>&#8220;He&#8217;s asleep,&#8221; Ryke said. &#8220;Got tired of his whining.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say to knock him out,&#8221; Jansen said, trigger hand itching. Was Mateo still breathing out there?<br/><br/>Ryke stared past Jansen as if he hadn&#8217;t heard him. &#8220;You&#8217;re just gonna&#8217; walk out with nothing?&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;We have six bags, the number Cordoba scammed off Paran. He paid for the rest.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;He disrespected Paran.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;And that message has been delivered through Nelson, Mateo, and our repossession.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never thought about grabbing some for yourself?&#8221; Ryke asked. &#8220;Who&#8217;d know?&#8221;<br/><br/><em>Cordoba would know, you stupid shit,</em> Jansen thought, but aloud, he just said &#8220;That&#8217;s the job. Cordoba pushes here, Paran pushes there, and a real drug war stays too costly for everyone involved. Right now, Cordoba can just claim his accountant fucked up. No one loses face to a rounding error.&#8221;<br/><br/>Grudgingly, Ryke stepped aside. &#8220;Since when did crime lords get so goddamn polite?&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;We take more than Cordoba stole,&#8221; Jansen said, carrying the duffel, &#8220;and he&#8217;s insulted. Honor demands he steal it back, and shit escalates.&#8221; As he walked back into the front room, he half-expected to find Mateo&#8217;s brains splattered everywhere, but the young man still breathed.<br/><br/>Some of Mateo&#8217;s teeth dotted the floor, of course, and the kid&#8217;s head had some nasty lumps, but he&#8217;d probably survive. This didn&#8217;t threaten the job. Wounding Cordoba&#8217;s thugs was understandable, but murder demanded recompense. Cordoba's <em>lobos</em> had a mantra &#8211; <em>sangre por sangre</em> &#8211; and Paran was very clear about not wanting <em>another</em> drug war on his hands.<br/><br/>&#8220;If it was me in charge,&#8221; Ryke said, caressing his steel knuckles, &#8220;we&#8217;d leave that little shit pinned to the ceiling.&#8221; He pointed at Mateo. &#8220;That&#8217;d tell Cordoba never to fuck with us again.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get going,&#8221; Jansen said, because he was feeling a very unprofessional urge to sock Ryke in the jaw. They didn&#8217;t have time for that. Mateo&#8217;s partner, whom Nelson had called away for a business transaction at Jansen&#8217;s suggestion, would find the battered accountant at any moment. They needed to be gone before that happened.<br/><br/>As they reached the door, a woman strolled inside. Jansen had ordered Ryke to lock it. He hadn't.<br/><br/>Jansen clamped down on Ryke&#8217;s gun hand with his own and smiled at the now wide-eyed patron, an older lady in a conservative blue dress. &#8220;Can I help you, miss?&#8221;<br/><br/>The lady&#8217;s wide eyes traveled over the wrecked tech on the shelves, the shattered knick knacks, and the bullet holes in the walls. &#8220;I, uh &#8230; I want to sell my wedding ring.&#8221; The counter hid Mateo's body.<br/><br/>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; Jansen said, as Ryke yanked his gun hand free. &#8220;Shop&#8217;s closed.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; the lady demanded. Now that Jansen had smiled at her, she&#8217;d recovered enough not to scream and run. &#8220;It looks like someone shot up the place!&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got good eyes,&#8221; Jansen said, as if noticing a dozen bullet holes was difficult. &#8220;We just answered the call. Robbery happened not ten minutes ago, but the perps got away.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;You&#8217;re police detectives?&#8221; The entirely too dense woman eyed them suspiciously.<br/><br/>&#8220;Yes ma&#8217;am.&#8221; Jansen nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;m Detective Forrester, and this is Detective Johnson. We&#8217;re still processing the scene, so you&#8217;ll understand if we can&#8217;t let you come inside.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;But what about my wedding ring?&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;I need to sell it.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;There&#8217;s a shop two blocks up,&#8221; Jansen said. &#8220;Second Chances. The owner will cut you a good deal.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the woman.<br/><br/>&#8220;You can go now,&#8221; Ryke added, leering at her like an asshole.<br/><br/>&#8220;Yes, well &#8230; I&#8217;ll just do that then.&#8221; The woman frowned, backed up, and left through the door. They watched her casting worried glances at the reflective windows as she hurried away. All she had was suspicion.<br/><br/>Jansen ground his teeth and pushed the door open. He had been halfway convinced Ryke would shoot her. If Ryke had shot her, he&#8217;d have shot Ryke, and then Paran would be rather disappointed in him.<br/><br/>As they walked to the autocar and the doors opened at their approach, Ryke grumbled something or other. &#8220;Never thought a life of crime would be so boring.&#8221;<br/><br/>Jansen tossed the duffel into the autocar and turned on a man he would very much like to dump in a river, if he weren&#8217;t a professional. &#8220;Less chance of getting shot if you take a light touch.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Seems you&#8217;re as light as they come, old man.&#8221;<br/><br/>Jansen got into the autocar. &#8220;Just keep your ears open. You&#8217;ll pick up the business fast enough.&#8221; Though as he watched Ryke fidget with his steel knuckles, Jansen was fairly certain he wouldn&#8217;t.<br/><br/><div align="center"><strong>THE END</strong></div>
