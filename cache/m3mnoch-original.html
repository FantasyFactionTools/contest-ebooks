Fishermen filled the main room, fresh off the day&#8217;s harvest and emptied their pints while spinning stories. It was loud, and boastful, and echoed with back-slapping joy. The blackfish season, thus far, had been grand.<br /><br />Jorge shaded his eyes as the sunlight burned through the grimy windows of The Owl and Perch. The woman sitting across the small, scarred-oak table cut a sharp silhouette as the ball of fire in the distance dipped into the lake.<br /><br />But he hardly noticed.<br /><br />The story she was telling had him wrapped in every word. Her flush cheeks and pulse-quickening beauty wasn&#8217;t helping his goal. She was beautiful.<br /><br />It was a damn shame he was going to have to kill her.<br /><br />&#8220;But, once he&#8217;d left the woman who loved him for another &#8212; another woman without his same passion for pirate&#8217;s gold, mind you &#8212; it was inevitable that he&#8217;d fail.&#8221; She picked up her mug of spiced wine, swirled and sipped, her gaze distant, soft, focused on a different time. Ten heartbeats later, she snapped back to the present and continued, &#8220;Especially after his spurned lover bartered her soul in exchange for the curse that forced him to sail the lake for eternity.&#8221;<br /><br />Jorge, running a finger around the rim of his own mug, asked, &#8220;Even with all his piloting skill, all his luck, after sailing through the channel to Ravenblood Lake. . .&#8221; He paused to wave his hand at the lake out the window, &#8220;The pirate never did find the hoard?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I guess not.&#8221; She shrugged, staring into her mug. &#8220;At least, I don&#8217;t think so, as people still say they see his ship when the lake mists are thick.&#8221;<br /><br /><em>Of course he never did, whore. You killed him first.</em><br /><br />Satisfied he had the right woman, Jorge leaned back on the wooden bench and gave an almost imperceptible nod to the barkeep. The man immediately turned to one of the young boys running food to the tables and sent him scurrying to the kitchens. The keeper straightened up and nodded back, face grim. Jorge&#8217;s companion didn&#8217;t seem to notice the exchange.<br /><br />&#8220;What was it you said your name was?&#8221;<br /><br />Glancing up, and through pouty lips, &#8220;Bethany.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Bethany, are you hungry? Buying your dinner seems the least I can do for so much information on this ghostly lake pirate. Edward was his name, right?&#8221;<br /><br />Bethany nodded, her emerald eyes taking on an enthusiastic shine. She really was lovely. He couldn&#8217;t fault Edward for his enfatuation.<br /><br />Jorge signaled the barkeeper over to their table. &#8220;Let&#8217;s eat then. I hear they have incredible crab cakes here.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221; Bethany nodded her head, turned and and smiled at the keeper as he arrived at their table. &#8220;For someone new to town, you&#8217;ve done well finding the best. They&#8217;re a staple here in town, surely, but no one does them better than The Owl and Perch. Right, Alton?&#8221;<br /><br />The barkeep straightened with pride, then bustled off, presumably to have their dinner prepared.<br /><br />The sun was fully set now. The scullery boys were lighting the candles at the tables and coaxing a fire to life in the hearth. It seemed only moments before their meal arrived at the table. Bethany grabbed one.<br /><br />&#8220;Delicious. Won&#8217;t you have one?&#8221; She broke the cake apart and slipped a large piece into her mouth.<br /><br />&#8220;In a moment, of course. I want to enjoy watching you eat.&#8221;<br /><br />She grinned at him, then opened her mouth and stuck out her tongue, showing him a mouthful of mashed up crab meat and bread crumbs. Bethany swallowed, giggling as she broke off another portion.<br /><br />Jorge smiled back at her. &#8220;How does the Dragon Thorn taste?&#8221;<br /><br />Bethany cocked her head to the side, swallowing the rest of the crab cake before she said, &#8220;Pardon me?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Dragon Thorn. The crab cakes are poisoned. I had Alton add it to the batch. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not eating them.&#8221;<br /><br />Her eyes widened. She looked down at the platter in between them.<br /><br />Jorge leaned forward, elbows on the table, fingers laced. &#8220;I know you killed him. You couldn&#8217;t take it. That he left you &#8212; for the likes of me.&#8221;<br /><br />Bethany&#8217;s eyebrows pinched together, her mouth hanging half-open. He could almost see the pieces falling into position behind her eyes. Almost see the thoughts connecting. It was time. Now, before the poison reached her heart and she fell to convulsions.<br /><br />Standing, he pounded the table. &#8220;We were in love, damn you. And you took it from us. From me. So, I&#8217;m taking everything from you.&#8221;<br /><br />She mumbled, closed her eyes, and shrank back from his looming form.<br /><br />Then laughed.<br /><br />It was a chuckle at first, but becoming a hearty belly laugh. Opening her eyes, she saw his face and the stupid look he must have worn. It made her snort with laughter again.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I just couldn&#8217;t hold it in anymore.&#8221; She reached out and grabbed another crab cake with her left hand and waved to Alton the barkeep with the other.<br /><br />Alton immediately barked several commands. The other patrons stood, as if remembering business elsewhere, and left all of their unfinished meals and half-full pints strewn about the common room. Finally, the barkeeper himself disappeared into the kitchen.<br /><br />They were alone.<br /><br />&#8220;Did you really think tossing a few coins around would work? This is my town, Jorge.&#8221;<br /><br />Jorge was still standing, leaning across the table, paralyzed with confusion, looking down at this vixen. This villain. Feeling much less intimidating.<br /><br />&#8220;The only reason you&#8217;re still alive is because I couldn&#8217;t figure out who you were. I&#8217;d assumed you were someone&#8217;s paid assassin, but anyone who would hire you is already dead.&#8221; She took another bite. &#8220;These are delicious. You should try one.&#8221;<br /><br />She pushed the plate over, but Jorge, still standing, simply shook his head.<br /><br />&#8220;Suit yourself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But, the thought of you two being lovers? I didn&#8217;t see that coming. However, Edward always had a sissy side to him. I suppose I should have guessed.&#8221;<br /><br />At the mention of Edward&#8217;s name, Jorge lifted his hand from where it knuckled the table, fully intending to punch the heartless wench in the face.<br /><br />Instead, she sank ten inches of steel into his chest, and he fell back to the bench, struggling for the hilt.<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s the same dagger I killed Edward with. You see, I wasn&#8217;t kidding about selling my soul. I used it to buy a fancy knife.&#8221; She waved half a crab cake at his chest. &#8220;Well, eternal life and a fancy knife. Do you like it?&#8221;<br /><br />Before he could respond, the area around the wound started sparking. Thin, blue bolts of lighting crackling from handle to hilt to him.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, it gets better.&#8221;<br /><br />Slowly at first, a living, pulsing, snapping web of blue energy spread from where the blade had entered his breast. Patterns of lightning and fire consumed his chest, then abdomen, throat, arms. It flowed over his face until devouring every inch of flesh.<br /><br />There was a final, intense flicker and it was done. The knife clattered to the floor and he stood there, translucent, one foot in the physical world, the other in the afterlife. Looking down at where his hand should be, he saw only the table and a platter of half-eaten dinner.<br /><br />Blue lightning arced, tracing the outline of his fingers for a brief moment. His body hovered, oscillating back and forth between transparent, and something like a glinting blue shadow.<br /><br />Bethany stood and walked around the table, making a show of passing through Jorge, and retrieved her dagger from the floor. &#8220;See? I did you a favor. Now, you can treasure hunt with your beloved for all of eternity.&#8221;<br /><br />The candles flickered and snuffed out as a sharp draft flooded the room, blowing through the tavern door, banging it open.<br /><br />&#8220;No, bitch.&#8221; The ghostly form of the Pirate of Ravenblood Lake flickered in and out of existence in the doorway. &#8220;You mistook the treasure I had been hunting for.&#8221;<br /><br />Edward&#8217;s shade moved closer to Jorge, and he could feel. He hadn&#8217;t noticed it before, but all sensation had ceased during the dagger&#8217;s transformation. But not anymore. Now, he felt. Memories of joy erupted from his chest and spread, not unlike a warm flush, throughout his form.<br /><br />He glowed brighter. Together, they glowed even brighter. A fervent heat filled both he and Edward. Together, they pulsed. Jorge and his love.<br /><br />Edward took Jorge&#8217;s hand and turned to face Bethany. &#8220;You may have won eternal life, Bethany, but now we&#8217;re rejoined, we&#8217;re not leaving your side. We&#8217;re taking all you have left.&#8221;<br /><br />Jorge, feeding on Edward&#8217;s strength, swelled and flexed in his new form. <em>The power. The raw freedom.</em> Glancing over, he saw an uncertain Bethany slowly backing away.<br /><br />He popped across the room, instantly at her ear, and whispered, &#8220;Your sanity.&#8221;<br />
