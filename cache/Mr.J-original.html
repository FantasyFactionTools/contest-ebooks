You are all doomed. Flesh will be seared from bone, blood boiling in your veins! Your eyes will swivel inside your head and melt into liquid and dribble from your sockets at the mere sight our Lord&#8217;s rebirth. You must praise the King.&#8217;<br /><br />The pink man was sweating now, as he always does, staring at me with his puffy little face and rotund belly like my very presence was demonic to him. Perhaps we are. Though if our little village, Chinua, is touched by demons then I fear what the Preacher&#8217;s soul is slick with.<br /><br />I shake my head slowly. I knew he must be crazy. The wives had tutted pitifully at the man&#8217;s chants of doom to our supposed unclean souls; I just didn&#8217;t believe it was true until now. I dared not touch him, save the diseases he might spew from his stale breath inhabits me. The strange, foreign sickness we had not known existed until his kind brought it here. Whole villages shrunk to their bare bones at a mere cough from a pink man &#8211; but Chinua had stayed strong, we let the healthy and abandoned from their now ghostly villages shelter within our clean walls. <br /><br />Chinua would always survive. No stink breath and foul boils of foreign man can take the land we grow and sow from beneath our feet. It&#8217;s ours and not his. Whatever his King might say, or do.<br /><br />He talks of this King all the time. He is coming. Apparently.<br /><br />I walk away from him, fearing I may catch more than just his ills. He has built his little nest in a white shed on the edge of town &#8211; painted it himself, placed his wooden symbol above the doorway and would desperately welcome any to his &#8216;paresh&#8217;. Whatever that is.<br /><br />I&#8217;d presumed all we had to do was swish our tail and he&#8217;d fly away, like the flies covering our cattle, buzzing about his King. But now - I worry. Not for him, but this King. We need no King here, no one does. We are majesties of ourselves &#8211; each and every one safe in their own kingdom. There&#8217;s been delicate talk on the villagers&#8217; lips.<br /><br />He was coming from somewhere, reborn or resurrected. A zombie? &#8216;No&#8217; &#8211; an elder had said, punctuating it with his puckered face and waving his wiry arms like sticks &#8211; &#8216;A Crown. A Golden Man in a Pretty Chair of Gold.&#8217; <br /><br />I do not understand why he speaks of such things with awe and wonder. He had too much life of the world before perhaps &#8211; before he came to Chinua and understood the way of the world. But if this King of the pink men be a zombie with a crown or a golden mortal in a chair &#8211; there was no room here. Not for them. Not with our own Lord to protect us.<br /><br />Chinua would fight back. I knew it would not be long. I just had to wait; I let the afternoon sun settle over me as I shelter beneath the big green leaves of the black tree in my yard &#8211; in my hammock, dusty feet, old feet now, dangling over the edge. I shake my head and shut my eyes for a sleep. <br /><br />I opened my eyes to a dying orange sun. There were folks talking in huddles nearby. The hum of tense chatter pulsing in the thick air of the early evening. The Woman was banging her crooked staff into the cracked ground, like she was digging for gold like the Spanyard&#8217;s who swarmed across the hills in our lands. I toppled out of the hammock and strode over to them &#8211; she had her face downcast, deep frowns buried into her leathery face. <br />&#8216;He is Coming.&#8217; She said, eyes watery and shimmering like pearls. <br /><br />I nodded and gestured for the crowd to part; after much grumbling I was left alone with The Woman, our oracle and guide &#8211; a teacher of the past and future. &#8216;There is blood in the streets. Fire in our homes. Death in the bones of us,&#8217; shaking her head as if to throw the images from her mind, &#8216;He is sleeping and shall wake. He must.&#8217;<br /><br />I turned away and sheltered my eyes from the setting sun, the shadows settling across that single white shed among our houses at the edge of the village &#8211; the pink man shaking himself out there now, a hand raised to the air, his echoes crying faintly on the breeze as he preached of his Coming King. <br /><br />The King. <br /><br />He would not be reborn, not here. Not in Chinua. <br /><br />I felt better now, not happy. For I knew it would mean his death &#8211; but I tugged the strings weaving from my conscience to my heart. It would be a better place with him gone. The King could not come here. <br /><br />I rested a gentle hand on The Woman&#8217;s shoulder and turned her about to lead her home. Her tent &#8211; lying in the cool shelter of the gum trees &#8211; was safe there. The King would not harm her.<br /><br />I rested my gaze on the pink man for the last time he would be sane. &#8216;The King is Coming.&#8217; He yelled into the sky. &#8216;The King is Coming.&#8217; <br /><br />I ignored him, trudging up my steps and closing the shawl across the doorway, securing any searing heat and light from entering the cool walls. There was only one Great King. He. <br /><br />He would protect us. Like He always did. No one needed the pink man&#8217;s golden zombie king.<br /><br />I waited all night, sheltered in the dark and carving my mask. We need not wear them. He did not expect it of us. But I consider it a respect. A standard to show Him, Chinua is in peace and servitude to his slumber. I hear the bells now, the humming in the air. The bugs and the animals alert and wary. <br /><br />I slip the mask over my head, embracing the great eye sockets and feel the wooden snakes tumbling from the face in my fingers. He is already screaming. The night has shattered to a greater blackness, a shining beacon consuming the pink man&#8217;s shed in an impossible crater. He is on his knees outside. The Chinua folk are coming now, one by one. We stand together to protect ourselves from the world &#8211; the world that wants us dead and perceives us as nothing but a bug beneath their boot.<br /><br />I stand before the pink man, wrapped in his white sheet, bawling like the child he once was.<br />&#8216;You are heathens! Demons. Sinners. Evil incarnate!&#8217; <br /><br />I shake my head, the rest of us following suit. <br /><br />&#8216;No sir. We are good here. Good Honest People. We do no harm to others cos we know the truth of this world. We do not need your false prophets &#8211; no white man&#8217;s lies. The Sleeping King. He knows our plight. Wraps us to his bosom sir. He will wait for us all, in the end.&#8217;<br /><br />The pink man screamed as he felt the bones in his face crackle and break, skin stretching from his face to tear away from flesh. He cried out and let the juice from his eyes settle in the back of his head and wept blood from his sockets, smearing down his pink face like tears. <br /><br />&#8216;The Sleeping King will wait for those chosen to inherit this world with him.&#8217;<br /><br />The abyss opened up to him, its sheer endless terror writhing into his very soul.<br /><br />&#8216;But not you.&#8217;<br /><br />The portal shuddered black and swam in a thick liquid &#8211; a watery world opening itself to him, an impossible place. <br />A towering city of glass under the sea. A throne at its centre, a crown for the Great One. A Sleeping King &#8211; taller than mountains, its sheer size a horror to the small man&#8217;s gaze &#8211; he could feel acid bubbling on his tongue, his innards willing to exhale themselves from his body at the mere sight. A grand creature writhing with its power. <br /><br />Asleep. Waiting. Protecting.<br /><br />The pink man slithered away into the night, his soul departing into the shimmering blackness before us. I watched carefully and breathed in its power. Every time He appears I feel drawn to Him, desperate to step inside and embrace his rest on the throne beneath the depths of our world. But there was too much to do, too much life to live, still. <br /><br />Chinua had to be protected. He would make it so, love us as much as we feared and loved him. It was the right way. I remembered the pink man&#8217;s words to me, his thick lips betraying his sour soul. If we are truly demons here, the men and the women outside, determined to break and stamp their will upon our lives &#8211; must be sheep wrapped in devil&#8217;s clothing. <br /><br />
