Severance Sharp, renowned hero, charmer, dashing rogue, champion of the War of the Rags and all-encompassing lover &#8211; stroked his magnificently chiselled face in the cracked mirror of his Captain&#8217;s Cabin. <br /><br />He was naked but for his black boots, fur lined of course and shining in the afternoon sunlight pouring through the great window at his back. He could feel it radiating against his skin, tanned and smooth and muscled, those weird little bumps prickling on the back of his neck and arms &#8211; what is the point of those? <br /><br />He scooped his genitals back inside his underwear as the stirring naked legs awoke themselves from his bedsheets. The swaying floorboards made their pretty eyes wobble inside their pretty heads. Heads. Plural. <br /><br />Susi and Sami peered at their satisfied lover and hero, the great Captain Severance Sharp. <br /><br />&#8216;Who were you talking to?&#8217; Susi said, peering around the room. <br /><br />Or was it Sami? Severance Sharp had forgotten which head was which. He was sure Sami was the lip biter, and Susi the ball pincher, but right now Sharp was interested in far more important matters. <br /><br />He was a man of alluring stature and shape, and pleasured himself greatly with frequent comfort of those fortunate enough to capture his pearly blue eyes. It was only as the sing-song shouts of the sailors above deck sailed into the luxurious cabin spilling with treasures and riches the two heads woke to their sharp new reality. <br />They were definitely not in Port Arbour anymore. Susi or Sami, short blue hair sticking out at the side, sat up in bed, dragging her twin head Susi/Sami up with it, still half asleep and bending at their shared neck. <br /><br />&#8216;Are we at sea?&#8217; Susi or Sami said. Severance Sharp laughed heartily, an attractive and gay noise. As harmonious and jovial as the finest bard and poet.<br /><br />&#8216;It is hard for a ship to not be in water my sweets.&#8217; He quipped, most quippingly.<br /><br />Severance Sharp was not just known for his wit, fantastic love making and a particular skill at making the best Goat&#8217;s Cheese Quiche you will ever set your intoxicating tongue too. But possessed of the most cunning, and devious mind. He&#8230;<br /><br />&#8216;Cap&#8217;n. Cap&#8217;n!&#8217; A rotund woman with a waist and chest covered in drooping pistols stormed into his cabin, breaking his chain of thought&#8230;<br /><br />&#8216;Yes. How may I assist you Bo?&#8217; <br /><br />The middle aged woman was bursting with excitement, almost hopping on her tiptoes like a girl and flashing her wide white teeth. <br /><br />&#8216;We&#8217;re there Cap&#8217;n Sharp. We&#8217;re at X!&#8217;<br /><br />Sharp clapped his hands together and cheered, extending his arms outwards like a bird, raising his delicately round but still very masculine chin, clicking his fingers. Bo scuttled past Susi and Sami in the bed, ignoring the exposed breasts and penis, fetching Severance Sharp&#8217;s gear.<br /><br />She dressed him in his finery; a dark red Captain&#8217;s coat of pristine gold buttons and excellently white cuffs, a white undershirt carefully exposing his thin tuft of dark chest hair. His black and gold belt was balanced around his thin waist, the sheaths of his sword and dagger hanging limp and empty. Severance Sharp held the key himself, a blue key shining on a cord round his neck. <br /><br />Susi/Sami exclaimed in disgust at their presence as they peered outside, pressing their heads against the window. The blue swash spraying against the glass, a dark tower looming above them.<br /><br />He laughed as he let the key click inside the box hanging on the wall. A sword and a dagger, glowing green, almost translucent. And very much magical. <br /><br />&#8216;You can&#8217;t just kidnap us.&#8217; Susi or Sami said from behind him, grabbing the nearest weapon with one of their hands, a silver apple paperweight on his desk. Severance Sharp pressed the cold green metal of the dagger against his smooth face, feeling its stirring presence in his fingertips, heavy pressure slicking against his marvellous skin.<br /><br />&#8216;Lady and Gentleman I must apologise, but if Captain Severance Sharp had kidnapped you, you would know it.&#8217; He grinned with a winning flash of his dark red lips and bright teeth, striding past the naked figure and sheathing the magic dagger. Susi/Sami wrapped themselves in their clothing and followed him out onto the deck. <br /><br />An enormous black, bulging castle loomed above the pillars of wood, thick black sails bulging in the searing wind slicing at their cheeks. It was balanced on sheer rock, consuming every inch of natural stone like a devilish sea creature, advancing into the sky like a God. <br /><br />The sailors cried out and swore with bitter tongues; salt on their faces and grit in their fingertips. Canon&#8217;s were readied, pistols cocked, swords wetted and axe&#8217;s hacked sharp with rocks. Severance Sharp smelt the air proudly, his muscular chest swelling with his abdominal muscles pulsing.<br /><br />&#8216;Welcome to Castle X! It marks the spot.&#8217; He snapped, grinning at Susi/Sami&#8217;s bulging pairs of eyes.<br /><br /><div align="center">*</div><br />&#8216;Look, when I said &#8220;I never want to see you again, ever, and if I do I will break your balls with a chisel and marinate them in a stew of wine, barley and beef while singing a sea shanty&#8221; us fucking was not what I had in mind.' Titus O&#8217;Brian said, flicking dried remnants off his skin. <br /><br />He was furious. With himself. <br /><br />His round face was purple, both from their anger driven sex that broke the wooden bed they were balancing on, and how a mightily pissed off fool he&#8217;d been made by the charm and genius of Severance Sharp.<br />Captain Sharp had crushed his former lover&#8217;s castle to pieces, the walls still crumbling like soggy pie on a pastry into the waters surrounding them. Although a fine specimen in the peak of his virility, athleticism and strength, you took certain risks when sleeping with a Leprechaun. Especially when it was a combination of pity and anger-make-up sex. <br /><br />Despite Titus&#8217;s protestations, his writhing in the sheets and his balled fists clenched as tight as his&#8230;teeth, Severance Sharp knew it was what the young man had always wanted, yearned for. Desired. He lit a cigarette and puffed at it idly, listening to the calming collapse of ancient castle walls outside the window. He sighed deeply, like a mysterious hero being mysterious and thoughtful. <br /><br />&#8216;Is this because of my dagger?&#8217; Titus said, offering a bushy eyebrow to Severance. <br /><br />The hero shrugged, handsomely. <br /><br />&#8216;You mean my dagger Titus, my dagger that I discovered while you were picking rocks in that cave.&#8217;<br /><br />&#8216;The cave I FOUND&#8217; His voice pitching to a squeak. A familiar sound, one Severance Sharp had enjoyed eliciting from the leprechaun, but now found it tiresome to his ears. Aching, an irritant. A noise a Captain such as Severance Sharp should not tolerate.<br /><br />At the mention of Sharp&#8217;s ancient, powerful and beautiful green dagger he averted his attention to its presence, resting casually on the war chest at the foot of the bed. A deafening crack thudded in the near distance. The walls rattled the ground. Captain Severance Sharp could smell the hint of gunpowder in the air as it wafted through the open castle window. Canon fire.<br /><br />But not an enemy, he knew what his girl sounded like. His ship was spewing anger. He leapt out of bed, displaying his fine form to the world and heard many booming claps. The sight of his ship clutched at his throat, sailing away from the harbour. Gulls circled around it, crapping on his deck. Sharp&#8217;s deck. <br /><br />He peered out of the window, letting the world see his exposed manhood. The world was lucky to be presented with such magnificence. But Severance Sharp had little time to consider such things. A two headed, leather coated menace stood proudly on his deck, at his wheel, the many arms steering it proudly with a captain&#8217;s hat perched on each skull. <br /><br />Susi and Sami. The bastard(s).<br /><br />Severance Sharp cursed and ran to his weapons, Titus drawing the sheets around himself in bed in fright. &#8216;What now?&#8217; he said, as the heroic and betrayed Captain Sharp dressed and found an empty sheath gripped in his hand. The dagger was gone. They must have crept inside during their love making and laid their filth ridden thief hands on it! The cowards! Scoundrels. He would make them pay, if it&#8217;s the last thing he would do! <br /><br />Now, he just needed a crew. And a ship. And weapons. He turned to the naked leprechaun in bed, and had a cunning idea.<br /><br /><div align="center">*</div><br />Susi and Sami turned proudly back to the castle as Captain Severance Sharp bounded about his room dressing himself in a flurry of panic. They raised their many hands in a single fingered salute to the raided castle, and sailed merrily out to sea, the magic dagger resting proudly at their waist.<br /><br /><br />
