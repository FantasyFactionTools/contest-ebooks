Songs and plays of his many deeds did not interest him, not in the way that kings and foreign emperors alike fussed over them. What was the use of his name being known if he was not there to partake of his glory? No, Dafyn wanted immortality of a rather more tangible variety. An old man now, he had devoted some fifty years of his fragile existence to the quest for life everlasting. Thus far, nothing had quite ended how he desired.</p><p>Many years ago, when Dafyn was in his prime, there had been a wandering soldier whose wounds healed within hours of coming near death. He had made bold claims of having found a lake in the mountains where the water granted great healing abilities and Dafyn, like a foolish youth, had gone in search of it. He'd found nothing, and upon his return he ordered the soldier beheaded. The man had not healed that wound.</p><p>In later years there was tell of a great black boar that would grant everlasting youth to the man who could catch it. Not much of a hunter himself, Dafyn had convinced his king to lead a great hunt. Alas, the endeavour had ended only in the death of his king at the hands, or rather the paws, of a large and particularly aggressive pack of wolves. No one had wanted to pursue beasts of legend after that incident.</p><p>Now, aged eighty-three and living on time best described as borrowed, Dafyn had found one last opportunity to reach his goal. The Cauldron of Pefach. Once the right mixture of ingredients was stirred into the great pot, or so it was said, the drinker would be granted immortality. Unfortunately, as was the way with these things, the ingredients of this particular elixir were rather hard to come by.</p><p><em>To fill the cauldron with elixir of life,</em></p><p>First find a king and cut him with a knife.</p><p>As an advisor to his king, just as he had advised the past three generations of the royal family, Dafyn had easy access to his king's person in even the most dire of circumstances. He waved his way past the twin guards outside the king's door and had himself announced. Soon he found himself sitting on the floor opposite his liege.</p><p>"Goodman Waulo," beamed King Hetcau, his young and somewhat chubby features glowing in the early morning light. "Is there a reason for your visit, or are you lonely in your tower?"</p><p>Dafyn returned the smile. "I have been studying the stars, my king," he said. "I fear there is some great calamity approaching us."</p><p>"Gods protect us," uttered Hetcau, making a ward across his chest. "Have you ascertained the nature of this evil?"</p><p>"I am afraid not, my king. Nothing brought about by men, that much I know. Perhaps some evil spirit seeking to enter your hall. Or the wrath of an angered god."</p><p>"Are they not pleased? I have made offerings every day."</p><p>"Then a spirit it must be." Dafyn shook his head sadly.</p><p>Hetcau looked imploringly at his advisor. "What can we do, Waulo?"</p><p>Dafyn paused, as if deep in thought. "I can endeavour to make a ward for you, to banish spirits from your home. I would however, require a small amount of your blood."</p><p>"My blood?" The King recoiled in disgust.</p><p>"Yes, my king. Spirits cannot stand any part of the body. It reminds them of what they no longer have." He smiled calmly. "I would only need a few drops, no more."</p><p>"Very well," Hetcau agreed, and placed him hand out, palm upward.</p><p>Dafyn bowed, and drew his knife. Crimson spilled across the blade, and he collected it in a small bottle. Then he made his excuses and left.</p><p><em>When king's blood has touched the pot,</em></p><p>Stir in redthorn, not little but a lot.</p><p><em/></p><p>Redthorn. Where am I to find redthorn? wondered Dafyn. It was a rare tree, and none grew in the kingdom so far as he knew. And yet the name had been mentioned recently? But when? And in what context? He wandered the corridors of the king's hall for many hours before he found his answer.</p><p>"Have you seen the Queen of late?" Dafyn heard one courtier asking another.</p><p>"No," replied the second man. "Not for a week, that I can think of."</p><p>"She can't still be in her garden can she? How many flowers can one woman need?"</p><p>"There's more there than flowers from what I hear. All sorts of herbs and roots."</p><p>Dafyn didn't hear the rest of the conversation. He was already heading for the garden. <em>Of course</em>, he thought. <em>The Queen had redthorn imported for her garden. Though gods alone know what she wants it for. Horrible stuff.</em></p><p>The garden was peaceful when he arrived. A small fountain bubbling away at the far end, great green bushes swaying in the gentle wind. The Queen was at the foot of one of those bushes, rummaging among the roots,</p><p>But Dafyn did not concern himself with the Queen. His eyes were fixed on the redthorn tree before him. He carefully reached in amongst the branches, fearful of impaling himself on those wicked hooked barbs. He broke off a large twig, removed his arm from the matted tree and slipped out of the garden before he was noticed.</p><p><em>With blood and thorn entwined together,</em></p><p>Add a dose of southern weather.</p><p>Far to the south, Dafyn knew, lay a great mountain empire where there was only one type of weather. The snowfall there was the stuff of legend. Deep enough to bury a man twice over and to freeze the beer in a man's cup. So he needed snow, but could he afford to wait for winter? Old age may have already finished him off by that point.</p><p>Then he remembered a gift the King had been given a few months before by an ambassador from that distant land. Dafyn hurried towards the lower levels of the hall.</p><p>Deep underground the gift was kept, where it was cold enough that you could see your breath even in the height of summer. Dafyn's shaking fingers fumbled with each door he encountered, but he was relentless in his descent. One door, two doors, three, a dozen. They all blurred into one in his failing memory. And then there were no more doors. Just a room.</p><p>At the centre of the room was a gift fit for a king. To keep his drinks cool in the summer, allegedly. A most bizarre gift, but one Dafyn was now profoundly grateful for.</p><p>A solid block, one metre across, of pure, southern ice.</p><p><em>And should any man choose to drink,</em></p><p>His life will be longer than he could ever think.</p><p>Dafyn stirred his elixir in the Cauldron of Pefach. There was not as much as he had hoped, but there would certainly be enough for him. The ice had melted, leaving the mixture a pale and watery red with shards of twig floating in it. For nearly an hour he stirred, until he was sure that the redthorn had infused the drink with its essence.</p><p>By rule of nature, the redthorn would surely kill him in such a quantity, but the ancients who devised the Cauldron had been knowledgeable about a great many things, and so Dafyn put his faith in them. His life in their power. At his age, he had very little to lose.</p><p>Dafyn dipped a goblet into the Cauldron, scooping in as much as he could. He lifted it to his lips, and then paused. "Gods bless me," he murmured. And then he drank.</p><p>The goblet fell to the floor as Dafyn staggered back. The flavour was vile, worse than rotting meat. He forced himself to swallow it all, redthorn and all. After that he waited. He waited until his limbs grew heavy, and his eyelids started to drop. He felt twice his age. Weak and powerless. Had he done something wrong? He tried to open his eyes, but found he couldn't. He willed his legs to move, but they refused. His heart pumped faster, his panic rising. he couldn't move, couldn't see. Couldn't do anything. He felt cold, his skin unnaturally dry.</p><p><em>What have I done wrong?</em> he wondered.</p><p>It was hours before they found him. But they didn't help him. Even if they had known he needed help, they wouldn't have known how. They moved him to the temple, thinking that was the right place for him. And for centuries after, men would still come to that temple, and marvel at the statue that wept.</p><p>Â </p></div>
