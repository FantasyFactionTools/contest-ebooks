They were arrogant, secretive, and in his opinion, batshit crazy. But he mostly didn’t like them because they knew too damn much about things he didn’t, and for all his skepticism, he’d seen them accomplish things even he couldn’t explain. So while he stood there in the dark, dusty room, watching the crooked old creature pour over pyramids of worn out tomes, making those terrible eldritch sighs he always made, Tanon couldn’t help but smirk and shudder at the same time.</p><p>“You’re late,” the man barked, eyes glued to the clutter sprawled upon one of his many ancient desks.</p><p> </p><p>Tanon cringed. That <em>voice</em>. “Been a while, Vekrys.”</p><p>Vekrys shifted his attention to an immense chalkboard, adding new members to intricate clusters of numbers, letters and arcane symbols.</p><p>“Not long enough in your opinion,” Vekrys said. It wasn’t a question.</p><p>Tanon frowned. Vekrys had a nasty penchant for saying whatever Tanon was thinking at the time, another reason Tanon didn’t relish these encounters.</p><p>“Well?” Vekrys said. “Out with it. You can see I’m very busy.”</p><p>“As compared to all those times when you’re not?”</p><p>“A scientist’s work is never done,” Vekrys mused. “To make knowledge your life’s pursuit is to accept that your life’s pursuit will never be fully realized.”</p><p>Tanon snickered. “You’re a ‘scientist’ now? What would the Tevichi Scholars say?”</p><p>“<em>The Tevichi Scholars</em>,” Vekrys scoffed, turning to him. “Bureaucratic frauds too prideful to admit they’re only playing at science. Too afraid to ask the <em>important</em> questions, to take the necessary steps to true <em>enlightenment</em>.”</p><p>Tanon’s skin always crawled at the sight of the decrepit man’s face. It was as wrinkled and leathery as his books, his teeth as yellow as the pages within. His pale eyes seemed to look deeper into Tanon than any ordinary man. Tanon’s hand was resting on the grip of his holstered pistol before he realized it.</p><p>The Alchemist noticed, and smiled. “The law has nothing to fear here. Why have you come?”</p><p>Tanon feigned nonchalance, turning to a shelf packed with obscure contrivances. He could feel Vekrys’s gaze. “The Chancellor of Olsanth is dead.”</p><p>Vekrys turned back to his work. “Shame. Heard he was a true ‘champion of the people’. I’m sure he will be missed greatly.”</p><p>“Even by you?” Tanon said. “The Chancellor hated Alchemists.”</p><p>“Politicians have always used religious dogma to further their careers,” Vekrys said. “He’s not the first to associate Alchemy with blasphemy. He won’t be the last.”</p><p>“He was murdered,” Tanon said.</p><p>Vekrys stopped writing. “Tragic.”</p><p>“Thought you could shed some light.”</p><p>Vekrys eyed Tanon contemplatively. “Do you know why I offer my services to you and no other Badgemen?”</p><p>Tanon shrugged. “Because I’m so delightfully agreeable?”</p><p>“You’ve seen the darkness,” Vekrys said. “You’ve seen war. Famine. Corruption. You know what men are capable of. What they’ll do to hide it. We have that in common.”</p><p>“And I <em>pay</em>,” Tanon said, dropping a leather purse on a stool with a bitter thump.</p><p>Vekrys smiled. “And you pay. But I must say I’m surprised you’d come to me concerning this matter. Olsanth is practically on the border, much farther than any man my age could travel. I’m not sure what help I’d provide.”</p><p>Tanon procured an ornate bronze syringe from his coat pocket. He tossed it to Vekrys, who snatched it with surprising dexterity, running his fingers tenderly over its entirety. He sniffed the needle and grimaced. “Where did you get this?”</p><p>“Next to the Chancellor’s body,” Tanon said. “Thought you might have some idea what it contained. I’m pretty familiar with most poisons. This one I can’t place.”</p><p>“No, you wouldn’t,” Vekrys murmured. “Few men could identify this particular elixir. Even fewer could manufacture it I daresay”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Vekrys crept to a shelf and grabbed a small, wooden chest that appeared as antique as him. He stationed himself at a desk littered with countless apparatus. Funnels and tubes criss-crossed over beakers and burners. Fluids dripped and gurgled. He went to work, opening the chest and removing several unrecognizable substances. He mixed them meticulously into a mortar and crushed them until they resolved into a deep red powder. He then added the powder to a solution and heated it over a flame placed directly beneath a complicated web of glass tubing. The flame made it rise and travel through the tubes like a serpent, hissing violently as it went.</p><p>“Wanna tell me what you’re doing?” Tanon asked.</p><p>“I have good news,” Vekrys said, eyeing the passage of the liquid through his instruments and into a vial. “Your Chancellor isn’t dead.”</p><p>Tanon snorted. “That’s very interesting, seeing as I saw the body myself. No pulse, icy skin, empty eyes. If he’s not dead he’s a damn good actor.”</p><p>“The miraculous effect of that syringe’s contents,” Vekrys said. “The Chancellor’s body is a corpse yes, but his <em>mind</em>, his <em>consciousness</em>, those I assure you are still very much alive. They are simply elsewhere at the moment.”</p><p>“Uh-huh. Where might that be?”</p><p>“Hard question to answer. There’s no literal name. It's a place that goes beyond our full comprehension. We can only theorize as to its true nature. All we know for certain is that it exists.”</p><p>Vekrys’s concoction was complete. He reached back into the chest and removed an object unlike anything Tanon had ever seen. It was an elaborate device comprised of both stone and metal. Cogs ran between sets of golden rings which surrounded a </p><p>plum-sized orb of black marble. A myriad of symbols and measurements were etched upon each ring. He set it down carefully and took the now filled vial in his hands.</p><p>“And with the right tools,” he continued, “one may interact with it.”</p><p>Tanon’s muscles tensed. “How could that be possible? And if you say ‘magic’ I’m going to find the most expensive-looking thing here and drop it.”</p><p>Vekrys simpered. “<em>Magic</em>. Such a misguided word. To call something magic is to assume there’s no explanation for it, no mechanics to illuminate how or why it is. But everything has an explanation. Some are merely unexposed.”</p><p>“Why not just kill him? What good is it to remove his consciousness?”</p><p>Vekrys looked down. “Only an Alchemist could create that substance,” he said. “But an Alchemist would know that. They’d also know that any Alchemist worth their weight could identify it. To leave that syringe would be foolish, nonetheless careless. Whoever placed the Chancellor in his current state either wanted that syringe to be found or, more likely, was unable to finish their work and wanted you on the wrong trail.”</p><p>“Finish their work?”</p><p>Vekrys frowned. “It is the theory of some that if a person’s consciousness can be removed from their body, it stands to reason that one may replace it with another, thereby controlling the body.” He met Tanon’s eyes. “Can you think of anyone who might stand to gain from controlling the body of a man like our beloved Chancellor?”</p><p>Tanon’s heart skipped. <em>Plenty</em>. “But if not an Alchemist, then who?”</p><p>“Intriguing question.” Vekrys held the vial towards Tanon. “Perhaps you’d like to ask him.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Vekrys raised his eyebrows. “The Chancellor.”</p><p>Tanon stared at the vial and frowned.</p><p>“Don’t fear my friend,” Vekrys said. “Ominous things tend to have ominous traits, but I have no wish to kill you, though your body is a fine specimen. If you should die in your prime, I’m sure there are several ways I could put it to good use.”</p><p>Tanon hesitated, then took the vial. “Not today I think.” He drank.</p><p>The reaction was instant. His tasted ash and smelled decay. His vision blurred and the room went quiet. The device on the table suddenly came to life. The rings rotated around the orb, humming vigorously, as if the device had sensed that Tanon drank the liquid, and was excited.</p><p>Tanon gagged, clutching his throat. “<em>What have you done to me</em>?”</p><p>Vekrys smiled his wraithlike smile. “I’ve enlightened you.” He gestured towards the device.</p><p>Tanon approached it. The orb glowed vibrantly despite its pitch-black hue, beautiful and menacing. It drew him in.</p><p>“Call to him,” Vekrys instructed. “Not with your voice. Don’t take your eyes off the orb.”</p><p>Tanon stared deeper into the orb’s light. The slightest sound crept into his mind. The room slowly faded until there was nothing but him and the light, that luscious, incandescent light. The sound became whispers, too numerous and distant to decipher. Tanon gazed deeper. The whispers grew in number and volume. They became voices, then cries, then screams, a haunting cacophony that filled Tanon with an overwhelming dread. They grew relentlessly until Tanon thought his head might burst. The orb shone brighter than ever, then went out completely. The voices dissipated and Tanon was left in darkness and silence that lasted a lifetime. Then a single voice called out from the void, clear and distinct.</p><p>Tanon recognized the voice immediately as the Chancellor’s, and his skepticism was put to the test once again.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
