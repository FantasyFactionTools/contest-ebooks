Carrion left too long to spoil in the summer sun.</p><p>Bartholomeo couldn’t quite decide.</p><p>Whatever it was, it was certainly disgusting. One of the worst smells he could remember. Bartholomeo immediately pulled the vial away from his assaulted nostrils, and shoved the cork back in.</p><p>The syrupy liquid was the color of post-drinking-binge urine. Tiny green particles sat in the yellow molasses, like insects trapped in prehistoric amber.</p><p>Bartholomeo scowled. After a final moment of consideration, he vigorously shook his head.</p><p>“No. I don’t like it.” Bartholomeo said at last.</p><p>“What do you mean, little one?” The crone’s voice was sweet, condescending.</p><p>“Please don’t ‘little one’ me, madame.” Bartholomeo snapped in annoyance. “And, please, take it. I’m sorry, but this was a mistake. The smell-and, and, and, because-I mean, it just looks-no, you can’t expect-I’m sorry, this was a mistake.”</p><p>His eyes scanned the wares on display in the large covered wagon: dusty leather-bound tomes, a dried monkey’s paw, something that looked like a jar of eyeballs in pickling fluid. There were trinkets made of crystal, totems carved from wood and bone. Everything was haphazardly placed, seemingly at random, on the shelves and tables in the tiny wagon. </p><p>Bartholomeo sighed. If the old gypsy wasn’t a witch, she certainly gave off that impression.</p><p>“You hesitate.” the crone purred. Her accent was thick and coarse, like the snarling of a wild animal. “You are not magically inclined, and this potion seems too good to be true, so of course you are wary. But young man, even without a sensitivity to the arcane, you must feel it.”</p><p>“Feel it? Feel what?”</p><p>“The magic within that vial.”</p><p>“I don’t…I mean, really. What assurances do-”</p><p>A liver-spotted claw of a hand shot out and gripped his arm. It took everything in Bartholomeo to keep from crying out as the crone leaned in and hissed.</p><p>“Little man, what do I care for assurances? You come into my wagon and ask for the magic to make you bigger. Stronger. To give you confidence. You are a worm, so of course you want these things, and this…what you hold in your frail little girl’s hand, is the answer!”</p><p>“Stop!” Bartholomeo squeaked. “Please! Just take it back already!”</p><p>“Can you even grasp the concept of magic, tiny sir? Not the sleight-of-hand practiced by sidewalk charlatans in the city, but actual magic? The building blocks of reality? The energy flowing through all things?”</p><p>Bartholomeo shook his head. Even though the crone’s eyes were milky and clouded, he felt extremely uneasy, as if she were boring holes into his brain.</p><p>“Magic was not meant for humans to ever understand. It is too ancient. It has built our world, but it is not of this world. Magic is raw power. It is unlimited potential. It is the infinite unknowable truth of all things, and I have captured it! Yes, I have sucked it out of the air, and the roots, and the earth, and the water. I have bottled it, distilled it, and shaped it into what you hold in front of you like so much rubbish. Fool! You don’t like the smell? I can’t be bothered making the infinite unknowable truth of the universe smell like strawberries and baby’s farts!”</p><p>“Now, see here-”</p><p>“Forgive my sister, good sir!”</p><p>Bartholomeo turned to see another old woman standing in the doorway of the wagon. She was just as ugly and wretched as the one he was talking to. She dropped the basket of herbs she had been collecting outside and swooped in like a bird of prey. Before he knew it, Bartholomeo found this old woman’s hands clutching his shoulders. Trapped on both sides, he felt like a piece of meat about to be devoured by two hungry predators.</p><p>“Please, sir, my dear sister is not of sound mind, as of late. This summer heat agitates her and puts her in foul mood.”</p><p>“Don’t speak for me, Florinda!” the first crone snarled, her rotten teeth grinding. “I refuse to let this city-dwelling praklova demean what we do! Shav’roska! Nielisch aun dashlinkov!”</p><p>Bartholomeo threw up his arms.</p><p>“Please! Please don’t!”</p><p>“Sir, fear not! She raves in the language of our ancestors, she isn’t casting a spell on you.”</p><p>“You’d know it if I was! Dumpfkleish.” </p><p>“Lucinda! Sir, please, come out from under the table, now. Let’s resume discussion with calm and civil voices. Lucinda, sister, brew us some tea, if you would. The lavender one, with some honey.”</p><p>Lucinda muttered as she hobbled away.</p><p>“Now, sir, from what I was able to catch, you seek to…”</p><p>“To change. Myself, that is.” Bartholomeo croaked, his throat dry. Was it his imagination, or had the wagon become unbearably stuffy?</p><p>“Why would you want to do that?”</p><p>“Do you know the town of Blackwood? Down river from here?”</p><p>“No, I’m afraid my sister and I never stay in one place for long. We come and go with the moon, and I believe that it is our first time in the area.”</p><p>“I see. Well, Blackwood used to be called Autumn’s Hearth, but it was gutted decades ago by a great fire. My grandfather was alderman at the time, you see. He was among the only survivors.” </p><p>“How tragic.”</p><p>“The town has been rebuilt, but, well, grandfather has renamed it Blackwood, and I believe it has been…cursed, ever since. My family, specifically.”</p><p>“What makes you say that?”</p><p>“I am the heir. My eighteenth birthday is tomorrow and I am to go on a hunt, as rite of passage. But, I am afraid. I had three older brothers. When father died, Elias was to inherit. But on his birthday hunt, his stallion threw him and his neck snapped. Then there was Peytar. On his birthday hunt, he was gored by the stag he was tracking. Next was Winthrop. He tried to break the curse by refusing the birthday hunt.”</p><p>“Wise.”</p><p>“Yes. I was just fourteen, and already terrified of what the villagers called The Von Richtmann Curse. But Winthrop, he was sure that he would break the curse. He would have been a wonderful alderman. Winthrop the Wise.”</p><p>“Except…”</p><p>“He choked to death on a turkey bone.”</p><p>“I see…”</p><p>“I am no believer of magic, madame.” At this point, the second crone, Lucinda, had returned with a mug of warm tea. Bartholomeo accepted it with shaking hands. “Thank you. But-you see, I have grown to manhood with this…shadow…hanging over my head. Like a shroud. My death shroud, waiting to fall.”</p><p>The two crones said nothing.</p><p>“The birthday hunt has always been a Von Richtmann tradition. But grandfather is just as afraid, maybe even more so, than I am. So, I need this magic potion. I must be strong to stay on my horse. I must be fast to sidestep a charging stag. I must be wise and alert, to avoid choking to death, or tripping on the stair, or being crushed by a chandelier. Do you understand? I do not believe in magic. But I believe that…something…wants to end my family.”</p><p>Florinda sighed. It was the tired and resigned exhalation of a soul who had lived too long, and seen too much. Lucinda said nothing.</p><p>“Your grandfather. What is he like?” Florinda asked quietly.</p><p>“Maximillian Von Richtmann…was a force of nature in his day. Stern, but fair. Strong and brave. He was the greatest warrior in the land, and wise as a sage. But, that was years ago. He has not been himself since the fire. I fear he will never be himself again.”</p><p>Another silence.</p><p>Lucinda finally spoke.</p><p>“Go home, young master. Take the potion, drink it at sundown. It will change you. At midnight, my sister and I will toast to your long and happy life.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>When Bartholomeo had left, the crones sat for a long time without speaking. </p><p>Outside, the wind rustled through the branches. Nearby, a wolf howled.</p><p>At long last, Florinda croaked.</p><p>“Max is alive.”</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>“Do you think he’ll be surprised to see us?”</p><p>Lucinda smiled. “I don’t see why. We haven’t aged a day!”</p><p>The two old crones cackled.</p><p>* * *</p><p>A shaggy wolf skulked up to the covered wagon sitting at the side of the road. It growled warily.</p><p>The flaps of the wagon opened and out stepped two ravishingly beautiful women. </p><p>The wolf fell silent.</p><p>The women laughed, flashing smiles that would make any grown man’s heart melt.</p><p>“Such a beautiful night for a stroll.” One of them giggled.</p><p>“If only Camilla were here.” The second beauty cooed.</p><p>“Let us finish this for our sister, then. For Camilla.” The first woman tucked a wicked dagger into a sheath hidden beneath her cloak.</p><p>“Yes. For Camilla.” They set off together, arm in arm, down the path. </p><p>Somewhere in the distance, a bell was ringing, and the screams of terrified village folk filled the air.</p></div>
