<span class="bbc_u"><strong>Ingredients needed</strong></span><br /><br />Starn reached into a round hollow in the tree trunk and felt around. Post. He pulled out the parchment. It read:<br /><br />For the attention of Starn, Hero of the siege of Arkan, Ranger General of Yunkar (Disgraced).<br /><br />The resident apothecary at Castle Seaview requires the following:<br /><br />One Owl (plucked and roasted over wood);<br />A lock of red hair;<br />Harnriss penis (extracted whilst the creature still lives);<br />Meet me at the docks when the moon is full for the final ingredient.<br /><br />This job should suit your considerable skills, friend. I don't care how you get the ingredients but before you have any moral qualms, remember it was your little mistake that got you discharged from the Imperial Rangers. Your wife and children Starn. You need the gold to keep a roof after their heads. You have two weeks until the full moon. Apparently some fat noble has a problem with getting his cock to work and needs the potion for his wedding night. Don't be late or you won't get paid.<br /><br />Good luck friend,<br />Vish<br /><br />Starn stuffed the parchment into a pocket inside his cloak and started to walk further into the forest.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Starn slathered mud from a fetid puddle on his face and wondered how he had gone from commanding the Emperor's Rangers to trying to poach an owl in the said Emperor's private hunting forest. He wiped the excess grime onto his trousers and strung his bow as the forest devoured the last of the sunlight. Bow strung, Starn sat and listened for the call of an owl. <em>I am such an idiot. Why did I do it?</em> His musings were interrupted by a distant hoot, which he preceded to follow. He stalked though the ancient trees following the owl's call until he reached the edge of the forest. The owl would return from the open fields and back to the forest. Starn had gambled it would return the same way it left. Starn watched the moon move across the night sky until the distinctive silhouette of a large grey owl glided across his vision. He smoothly aimed his bow, calculated the required power and angle, then released the bowstring. The owl screeched as the arrow slammed into its body. It's once noble and graceful form tumbled inelegantly to the ground. Starn couldn't help feeling some empathy with the creature. <br /><br />***<br />Starn threw the owl carcass on the kitchen table. <br />"I found some work Neave."<br />His wife fixed him with the same empty glare he had been greeted with everyday since the incident. <br />"I need this plucked and roasted over wood. It's for the apothecary. Where are the children?"<br />She gestured toward the stairs. <br />"Asleep"<br />She turned away and carried on cleaning a large pot. <br />"Look I am trying my best here. I know I made a mistake but..."<br />Neave interrupted his protestations. <br />"I don't want your self pity. I want gold to feed the children. Since you ... did what you did ... there's not been much of that around. So go and kiss your children goodnight, if you can manage to stop thinking about yourself. Then I want you to go out and get some gold. A dead owl is not going to keep a roof over our heads".<br />Starn shuffled out and up the stairs to look in on his two daughters. He felt the same bottomless love he always experienced when he was with them. Only now that pure and wonderful feeling was despoiled with guilt. He gave them each a kiss on the forehead, careful not to wake them, and crept out. <br /><br />"Well lieutenant, your a wonder between the sheets" <br />Sabine let her long red hair out of the tight bun it was bound in. Starn watched it cascade down her ivory skin until it obscured her breasts. He attempted to feel revolted by himself. He had removed a few medals from his old dress uniform and died his hair to ensure he wasn't recognised. Sabine had proved easy to charm into bed.<br />"Where did you learn to pleasure a women like that".<br /><em>With my wife.</em> He thought regretfully. <br />"I am going to go to the bar and get us some drinks. Make yourself comfy lover."<br />Sabine swept out of the room after pulling on her dress. <br />Starn wasted no time turning out Sabine's drawers. He rummaged until he found her hairbrush and pocketed the hair that had accumulated on it. He exited via the open window and began to climb down the back of the tavern to ground. <em>If only I had done this last time. No, if only I had asked her name. If only I had been a good husband</em>. <br /><br />Haris was lot fatter and balder than when Starn had said goodbye to him after the Seige of Arkan. <br />"Hey Haris. It's been a while".<br />"Who the fuck are you? I don't associated with anybody who wears flea ridden rags. Off with you now, unless you want to fight in this 'ere arena behind me."<br />"Actually that's exactly what I want."<br />Starn placed his thumb and little finger together before extending the remain three toward his old comrade. <br />"I'm surprised you've forgotten how I rescued your sorry arse from the wrong side of Castle Arkan's wall when you decided to fall of".<br />"General...Starn. I didn't recognise you. I'm sorry sir. No one has seen you since...the incident with the High Judge's daughter." Haris reciprocated the hand signal.<br />"Look I don't want to talk about it. I need you to get me into the arena for the beast fights. I need to kill a Harnriss. Then I need you to get me out again. Hence why I am dressed as a down on my luck criminal. Which I pretty much am these days."<br />"Look Starn, I know things must be bad but what your contemplating is suicide".<br />"Desperate times and all that. Just like at Arkan."<br />"You saved a lot of people at the siege sir. I'll see what I can do."<br /><br />***<br />The Harnriss ripped at the throat of a hapless combatant in the arena. The man's spear kept glancing weakly off the creatures scales. The serpentine beast had five sets of short but powerful legs jutting out of its segmented body. It's jaws formed a cross shape with four sets of teeth when open and were as wide and tall as its body. Starn stood at the side of the arena as it sinuously wove around the helpless criminals in the arena, tearing them apart. It would be coming for him soon. He had read extensively about them in Ranger training but had never faced one. The last man fell, bitten in half. Starn backed up to the towering wall of the arena hoping his strategy was sound. The Harnriss kicked up a minor dust storm as it careened toward him. Starn held his ground and wedged his spear between the bottom of the arena floor and wall at an angle. The beast leapt at his throat. Starn rolled at last second. He felt teeth tear jagged slices in his arm. Then he heard the bestial howl as the creature impaled itself on his spear. He didn't have long. Knife in hand, Starn carefully approached the rear of the creature. It's thrashing reached a crescendo as the blade went up through a small hole between its legs and sliced the penis clean off in one fluid motion. Starn sprinted toward the arena gate as the poison he had coated on his blade finished the creature off. <br /><br />***<br />"I have the ingredients Vish. I am here for the last item and my money."<br />"Well done friend. You have always excelled. First in the military, now in crime. We will need some help for the final ingredient Starn."<br />Starn counted five heavily built men emerge from behind some shipping crates. <br />"Pin him down boys" <br />Starn stood dumbfounded as the heavies rushed him.<br />"What is this Vish?"<br />"Bring me his woman"<br />Two new thugs hauled Neave out of a barrel and threw her at Vish's feet.<br />"What have you done with my children?"<br />"Sold I'm afraid. To the slavers. Perhaps you can find them when this is over."<br />Vish grabbed Neave by the hair and slashed her throat.<br />"You bastard."<br />Tears came unbidden as the only women he had ever loved bled out on the slimy dock side. A thug grabbed him round the neck and scraped a vial up his cheek.<br />"The last ingredient are tears shed in grief. Thank you for those Starn. Now, don't be sad. Just think, your cock bought doom to you and yours but it did mean this miraculous cock healing potion could be brewed. I am sure the little noble will be pleased. If you boys stopped thinking through your members, then you'd all be rich like me. Bye now".<br />Starn crawled over to Naeve and cradled her in his arms, wondering where he could find a potion to kill a man.<br /><br /><br />
