Over to the Egyptian Mau Weathercat Team -<br /><br /><em>Hi Crooksy, Chief Mau bringing you today's weather . We prophecy it'll reach a scorching top of 50C for the wild Demon Devon Rexers out there in Grand Forks, so seek some shade and streeeetch. Cooler for the Ragdoll Rogues of Thief River Falls, with 30C and sunshine, so a good day to check out the fishin' with a swift paw and a fast hook.. </em><br /><br />Thanks Mau. All just right for our humpadoo bootscootin' Cat Country Mewsic Festival kickin' off today and all through the week here in Fisher, best Cat city of this great little ol' State. Glad the skies are calm as some of our fantastical neighbours are joinin' us from Country Plains. <br /><br />Dragon Highlord Vulk Agni is flying across to present Red Hot Prizes for Best Howlin' and Yowlin', Sleekest and Smoothest, Ruffest and Tuffest. He's bringing local MP Wilde Hunter and The Naughty Nymphs &amp; Saucy Satyr Singers, all headin' here to make sweet mewsic at the Festival and to host Mad Midnight Picnics In The Woods afterwards. <br /><br />Woooohooo can't wait for splendour in the catnip, tanglin' in the treetops. Hmm, over to a message from our sponsor &#8211;<br /><br /><em>Hello there Cat Country charmers, The Amazing Maurice here with that product you've all been waitin' for, my perfect product, Spraaay. <br />Do you suffer from Itchybum?

But hurry, hurry The Amazing Maurice may leave town&#8230;..</em><br /><br />Sounds soothing, back to a listener request on your favourite local radio Cat Country 100.3FM. Mungojerrie and Rumpelteaser of Thief River asked for a Golden Oldie, Norwegian Forest Zombison's heart rending hit, Stand By Your Troll, a touching reminder of the value of true love however painful the sacrifice. <br /><br /><em>Sometimes it's hard to be a Zombie<br />Giving all your love to just one Troll<br />You'll have dead times, <br />And she'll have live times<br />Doin' things that you don't understand.<br />But if you love her, you'll forgive her <br />Even though she gave away your hand<br />And if you love her, give your toes to her<br />Cause after all, she's just a hairy Troll.<br /><br />Stand by your Troll, <br />Give her an arm to cling to <br />An eyeball to come home to <br />When nights are cold.<br />Stand by your Troll and show the world you love her<br />Rip out your heart and love her like no other <br />Stand by your Troll.<br /></em><br /><br />What a great song, what a great singer. A quick cut to Catnip Now Network anchor, Catiane Amanpaww, for an emergency newsflash -<br /><br /><em>The value of the Purr is falling, markets are reeling on Wail Street, with the news that media baron Mercat Cattodumpf, has gained 98% control of Owlpost Inc. under suspicious circumstances, leaving vital questions unanswered.<br /><br />Why did Cheshire Cat fade out of the boardroom?<br /><br /> Why did Si and Am sell out so fast and catch the Orient Catspress?<br /><br />Why are Warm Kitty and Soft Kitty hiding in Sheldon's slippers?<br /><br />Where oh where has Pussycat gone? Where oh where can she be?<br /><br />Major stock holders Pussycat and Hedwig have disappeared together. It is rumoured they went to sea with plenty of money, but no sightings by the Seacat Patrols have been reported. Another source suggests they went to London to visit the Queen, but this is unlikely as she's been isolated since the Catinental Catflap closed. <br /><br />Gobblecat King Jareth of White Persia is furious and has hired Mister, a famous Chicatgo catective to search for them, with trainee Wizard Baker. <br /><br />We asked Lord of the Skies Gwydir what this would mean for airmail. He was concerned that letter post will become obsolete and all communication controlled through Cattodumpf's nefarious See-mail. The Tortoiseshell Council will confer on preserving quill and ink and report back early next century.<br /><br />The Cat Mint assures us that there is sufficient Purr in the Reserve Cupboard to guarantee Mousegages on your homes, do not panic. Further announcements later.</em><br /><br />Holy Litter Catwoman, CNN hinting at some backsider trading there. Should anyone see Hedwig or PussyCat you could dob them in to the authorities. Or not. Depending on how you feel. And what they have to offer. Cats always know which side their paws are buttered, after all. Time for another important message from our sponsors -<br /><br /><em>Calling all WildCats, do you suffer from Bloodtooth? Spray on Spraaay and those fangs will shine like ivory castles&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..hurry, hurry&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</em><br /><br />You're on Cat Country 100.3FM, your favourite radio station, welcoming our very own local jazz-cat, Manx Mooncat, from Hard Ice Caf&#233;, believe he has a very special song for us.<br /><br /><em>Peace and light, Crooksy, peace and light. Good to be on 100.3FM. As you can imagine life with no tail is a harsh start, so I grew up on the big city streets hangin' with Sundog the Hippypup. Then one night the Dark Barkers caught me and dragged me to a life of hell. Today I'm singing one from the heart, Mirkwood Prison Blues for my friends still languishin' there. <br /><br />I hear the Nazdogs comin'<br />Demons, kept by evil men<br />And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when <br />I'm stuck in Mirkwood's dungeons and time keeps draggin' on <br />But those Nazdogs keep a-comin altho' ol' Sauron's gone.<br />When I was just a baby, my mother said to me <br />Always be a good King, don't never wear those Rings<br />But I wanted to be famous and flashed it, low and high<br />Now I hear ol' Sauron laughin' and hang my head and cry.<br /><br />I bet there's hobbits feastin' on a fancy homecooked stew<br />They're probly drinkin' coffee an' smokin' pipeweed too<br />Well I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free<br />But those Nazdogs keep a-flyin' and that's what tortures me<br />Well if they freed me from this dungeon and loosed me from this mine<br />I could die a little gentler, seein' stars that shine<br />Far from Mirkwood prison, that's where I want to stay<br />A-livin' with the hobbits to sing my blues away.</em><br /><br />Wahey Manx, I'm not an emotional mog but my whiskers are twitchin', that is sad. Relieved you are safely back with us and reminding you listeners Manx will be at the Festival all week, be sure to drop some Tunachews in his bowl if you see him.<br /><br />Award winning Mercat author, Celeste Sunk, wrote Princes of Toads, which won the 2015 Yugo Award for Best New Fantasy. Our much loved critic, Mrs Norris of Furry Fantasy Faction is here with a review. Glam grooming to you Mewriel, and glad to hear the retired founder of FFF, Mr Argus Filch is settled in Caretakers Cages Retirement Home.<br /><br /><em>Luscious lapping to you, Crooksy. This first book of The Spawn Empire series introduces ToadPrinces Jaran and Jog. <br />In their youth they fall foul of the FrogFather and are cruelly parted. Jaran is banished to ride a camel in the terrible Dry Sherry Desert, far from water and squishy bugs. Tiny Jog is transported by rabid reindeer to State of the Leering Snowman. He trudges through the frozen waste, desperately yearning for his beloved soulmate Jaran. That little spec of green in an unwelcoming, white, white world while Jog struggles to control a humpy horror amid burning sand. <br /><br />Oh listeners you will search your souls, as you drag yourself along with each tortuous webfootstep or gasping gulp. This book merited 4 stars for the exquisite anguish I felt for our dear ToadPrinces. If it had included the Ice Giants Saga or the Bedouin Brouhaha I would have given it that one extra star. Maybe in Volume 2. I will not spoil the story, but urge you to read for yourself. Hint &#8211; Happy Ending!!!! Only $5.99 at Rowl's Book and Bootlegge Emporium on Prowl Street. </em><br /> <br />Bringing you our friendly sponsor again<br /><br /><em>Spray on some Spraay<br />Spray every day &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..<br /><br /></em><br />Time to leave Country Cats 100.3 FM. <br />But you are all welcome back for a Mad Midnight Picnic&#8230;&#8230;.<br /><br />
