A darkling daughter came one night and on the mantle did alight.<br />Before the gathered court she sprang. Ere drawn was sword she clearly sang,<br />Of silver webs that bound them all, both noble lord and lady tall,<br />Encircling mighty crown and land in falsely fragile mind and hand.<br /><br />The king and queen their captain shame, send slinking from their court like knave,<br />For drawing weapon threatening, then happy eyes watch maiden sing.<br /><br />&#8220;And would this court so fair and wise, not profit from the loss of guise,<br />obscuring greater deeds and dreams that otherwise beyond you seem?&#8221;<br /> <br />"What gifts have you to change this land?" asked silver bearded king his grand<br />and queenly wife upbraiding laughs, but darkling daughter shrugs "My draughts."<br /><br />"Draughts?" queenly wizened matron frowns, and wrinkles smooths from well-worn gowns,<br />Once fair on shoulders smooth they hung. "Draughts - potions like I saw when young?"<br /> <br />"Nay fair haired queen thou never saw, such potions peerless with no flaw,<br />Imbued with powers deep and strong, to limber limb and make life long.&#8221;<br /> <br />"No powers these thy drinks command &#8211; my butcher's meats also make grand<br />The body's sinews, strength, and size, what other power in you lies?&#8221;<br /> <br />"Great powers vast I summon for the sweetly dripping dews I pour,<br />&#8216;Neath moonlit skies with thunderous dread to fill the vials blue and red,<br />With starlight caught on skein of silk, I weave the pearly drops like milk,<br />In glen remote &#8216;Neath heaven&#8217;s stairs, where neither man nor maiden fares.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;O! Maiden fair we plainly see, great craft you wield and mightily,<br />Now plainly boons and gains do tell, so we might craven council quell.&#8221;<br /> <br />"More deep the power I implore, than any else hast held before,<br />To quicken mind and senses hone, to give youth&#8217;s strength to anchor throne."<br /><br />"Your price young maiden quickly say, what wicked thing desired to pay?"<br /><br />&#8220;My single fee: to welcome me, as daughter of thy family,<br />When time has sped and from you fled, your crown shall rest upon my head.<br />The sole exception that be said, thy choice in husband I shall wed.<br />So fully joined our powers would, the land and kingdom do great good.&#8221;<br /><br />Thus spoke the king in mighty voice, uplifting court his cry: &#8220;Rejoice!<br />Her price is but a second boon, to powers offered and right soon,<br />No heirs have come to ancient line, this maiden comes with offer fine,<br />No children ever here have roamed, small price is this: to grow our home!&#8221;<br /><br />The darkling daughter potions brings, the red to queen, the blue to king,<br />Corks then to courtly floor they cast, a joyful look they share &#8211; one last.<br /> <br />And drinking down the bitter draught, says maiden to the court &#8220;At last!<br />My bargain is complete you see, from poison strong they cannot flee, <br />For never should a land be ruled, by those so swiftly, surely fooled.<br />Bring Captain wise to me for groom, our wedding feast will now this room.&#8221;
