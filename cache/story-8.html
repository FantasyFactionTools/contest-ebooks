<div class="shortstory"><h1 id="story8">The Shepherd</h1><h2 class="authorByline">By ThiefofHope</h2><p> The pamphlet – attributed to the Sanctimonious Saints - had been right. Sex was not at all what the bishops would have you believe. I pushed open the door to my house, tired after the late night. A quiet voice greeted me.   “What do you think you’re doing?” Mother’s usual suspicious voice. She sat in a chair in the house’s main room, prayer book on her lap.   “Coming home after staying at Ria’s last night.” I kept walking.   “Oh?" Her tone stopped me. There was a note of confidence, like she had caught me at something she disapproved of. I had only heard that tone a few times in my life, but when I had, the conversation had never ended well for me. I turned to face her, and noticed a square clay jar striped with red resting on the small table next to her chair. That jar held the tea I used to keep myself infertile while exploring my body.   “Why were you searching my room?” I yelled. “I have the right to know what’s going on in my daughter’s life.” I could never decide whether I preferred to believe she postulated that or the priests had fed it to her.   Mother spoke again. “I am disappointed.” Tears welled in her eyes. I didn’t care.   “In me? No. You’re disappointed you don’t have the pious daughter you always wanted.” I knew better than to goad her, but Mother would never forgive the tea in that clay jar.   “I am sending you to a nunnery.” Like that would make me pious.    As I opened my mouth, Mother’s forehead creased, as it did every time she knew I was about to disagree with her. “I am not going to a fucking nunnery.” I screamed. It felt good. I strode out the door, then looked back at Mother over my shoulder. “I’m already fucked, aren’t I?”   She glanced over at the jar. “It appears so.” Anguish fought with rage and despair. It seemed strange to hear my emotions in her voice.   Ten paces later, I heard a crash behind me, followed by a door slamming shut. Mother had thrown the jar. It had shattered, and a slight breeze scattered the leaves inside. I didn’t need them anymore, but maybe I could sell them, if I collected them. I hurried over, pulling a handkerchief out of my skirt pocket.   I picked up one of the shattered pieces, attempting to pour the leaves off it into my handkerchief. As I shook them off, I noticed a pattern etched on the inside. Runes.   There were more on the other pieces. I forgot about the leaves – they had mostly blown away already – and gathered the pieces, wrapping them in the handkerchief before hurrying away. I did not want another confrontation with Mother.   I would not go to a fucking nunnery and spend my days listening to unwed mothers pine after their loves and former prostitutes repent of their sins. Although, maybe I could get the nuns to exile me. That was my most promising option. I had heard that the Sanctimonious Saints would get people out, but I had been trying to contact them for months without any success.   I found a bench in the park, set my bag under my feet, and pulled out the clay shards. I laid the pieces next to me and started organizing them, using the runes as a guide. Who had written words on the inside of a small infertility jar? Why?   The last pieces revealed a large intricate design. It looked familiar, like one of the theocracy’s official seals, but not quite. Surely the priests weren’t trafficking in infertility teas; they always needed more people to build their altars. Underneath the design, there was a short phrase. I murmured the words to myself as I read them. “You broke the jar; let’s see who you are.” I did not finish the last sentence. Another voice had joined mine. A woman stood behind the bench. She had short, spiky brown hair and wore a slim dress. Proper, yet flattering.   “Who are you?” she asked.   I did not respond as she walked around the bench and sat down next to me, picking up one of the shattered pieces.   “That’s mine,” I said. The woman looked down her nose at me. If she was trying to intimidate me, she failed.   Her mouth twitched. She examined the shard in her hand, peering at the design. “Why did you break the jar?” she asked, looking over at me.   “I didn’t.”   She nodded. Her gaze traveled from the shards to my face, then down my shirt to my bag underneath my feet. I tensed my muscles, squeezing the bag with my shins. “You are a rebel.”   Who was this woman? Did she come from a nunnery, recruiting wayward girls? I smiled at her. “And what are you going to do about it?”   She held my eyes with hers. “What are you going to do about it?”   “Nothing.” I stared at the woman, silently challenging her. I would never become a quiet, pious citizen.   “Is that true?” The woman placed the shard back on the bench, smoothed her skirt, then stood up, and walked away.   I watched her leave. One question dominated my thoughts: how had she known what the jar had said?   Then stars exploded across my vision and pain erupted in my skull. * I found myself lying on my side on a soft bed. My head throbbed. I groaned.   Then I heard noises: a shuffling and a rustling. I opened my eyes, but could not see much. A dim glow illuminated markings etched in a wall opposite me. They looked like words, but in no language I knew.   “It is time to choose.” I knew that voice. It was the woman who had asked about the jar. I sat up, too quickly. My vision faded, and I strained to bring it back. When it did, I took a deep breath as I looked at the woman. She wore the same clothes and impassive face as before.   “Who are you?” My voice creaked.   “It depends on what you choose.”   I refused to play her games. Not before I knew the rules. “What did you do to me?”   “I did nothing.” Her face shifted to display mild innocence.   I tried again. “What did you have done to me?”   “You don’t need to know the details. The outcome is what’s important.”   “And what is that?”   “Choose.”   I opened my mouth to give in and ask her what I was supposed to choose, but before the words came out, her forehead creased. Like Mother’s when we fought. But I didn’t want to fight this woman until I knew exactly who and what I was fighting.   I put my hand to my head, rubbing my temples to try and dull the throbbing while I thought. The woman had no way to know what I was going to say, but she knew I would say it quickly, without thinking, and that disappointed her. Why?   I tried to remember our conversation from earlier. Had she talked about a choice? We talked about the broken jar, and she had accused me of being a rebel. And I’d said I wasn’t going to do anything about it. Was she recruiting for a nunnery?   Did it matter?   I brought my hands down from my head and looked the woman in the eye, despite my pounding heart and trembling fingers.   “I choose to reject the saints and their pious, restrictive, controlling theocracy.”   Three ponderous heartbeats later, the woman smiled and stuck out a hand.   “Welcome to the Sanctimonious Saints.”  </p> </div>
