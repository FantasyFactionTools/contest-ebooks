<br/><br/>The Shepherd<br/><br/>Divchena stood at the heart of her well-kempt sheepfold, crook in hand and a modest smile on her black lips. That morning, after she led her rams and ewes to the mountainside and her lambs to a low meadow on the banks of the River Polikni, which wound along the flower-laden floor of Zelchat Valley, she bound a miniscule orb to her thigh, underneath the pleats of her grey shift, in preparation for her debt collectors' arrival. The tattered hem of her skirt grazed her knees.<br/><br/>When the sun hovered overhead, three Senkcha Family representatives arrived at the southernmost edge of Divchena&#8217;s pastures, each riding a hillwalker&#8212;an enormous, gentle beast far larger than a yak and hardier than cattle, with ribbed horns as thick as the trunk of a young tree.<br/><br/>&#8220;Divchena Maluk.&#8221; Podim, the head of their triplet, stopped his mount with a yank of its leather reins. He climbed down the knotted fur dangling from the creature&#8217;s side.<br/><br/>Watching him with attention keener than an owl&#8217;s, Divchena brushed the side of her thumb from the pierced bridge of her nose to its petite tip; she flicked her wrist to show Podim and his companions her empty palm.<br/><br/>&#8220;She I am.&#8221; With luck, the early display of respect might ease the tone of their conversation.<br/><br/>Podim returned the gesture. He approached the sheepfold on foot. &#8220;You have some things to explain.&#8221;<br/><br/>Divchena smirked. She shifted her weight onto one leg, free hand on her hip. Her fingers, sore from tearing off hangnails in boredom while she was waiting for their arrival, brushed against the night-blue wool of her capelette as she leaned her crook the tiniest bit nearer to her side.<br/><br/>One of his companions, a dishevelled woman clutching a sling&#8212;Podim&#8217;s wife, Zelina&#8212;dismounted. She ran halfway to the sheepfold and paused. The bitter-faced man who arrived with them carrying nothing but deep-set creases on his brow remained atop his hillwalker, arms crossed.<br/><br/>Divchena owed the married pair a fair sum, to say nothing of the grandiose amounts she had stolen from their new family. To Podim alone, she guessed at least a ram&#8217;s weight in tadril and an extra hornful for interest. Zelina had claim to a fresh silk headscarf and three master-wrought rings inlaid with her pick of precious gems. Since Divchena didn&#8217;t recognise the old man, she supposed a peck on the cheek for his good humour and cooperation would suffice. To their detriment, they sacrificed their right to compensation months ago and knew why. Divchena had no intention of repaying them, now or ever.<br/><br/>Podim, tight braid of mint hair swinging in the slight wind, leant over the wooden sheepfold gate. A thin rod of hard candy drooped from the corner of his mouth. &#8220;I reckon you owe us lots more tadril than I suspect you have left. Bet it felt good to think you got away clean, yeah? Thought you had my whole family fooled? Well, sezha, you ain&#8217;t fooled me.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;You were one of my most intelligent,&#8221; Divchena conceded. Had he and his wife not left, this wouldn't have happened. This, however, was the path they wanted, so they had to live with their choice.<br/><br/>&#8220;I know.&#8221; He took the sweet out of his mouth to spit. &#8220;Get on out here. Ottnik&#8217;ll be easy on you so long as you don&#8217;t try nothing violent.&#8221;<br/><br/>Divchena chortled. Ottnik, called the Badger by locals, skinned thieves alive if he caught them, and the loathsome horde of brigands he governed would watch her skin peel off with glee. Those who stole from the Senkcha Family rarely escaped their labyrinthine camps with time to enjoy their earnings, much less returned&#8212;and came out again, and later repeated once more for the story before fleeing for good.<br/><br/>She did not deny her penchant for tasteful revenge. Sneaking into the Sankcha Family&#8217;s main camp and robbing them blind, mute, and lame hadn't been done out of irreverence, but policy; they stole a bit of her flock, so she took a chunk of their goods. Thus, the trade was fair. By the measures of the pure and lawful, they had merely&#8230; transacted.<br/><br/>Shaking her head, Divchena yawned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stay right here. As you guessed, I have nothing to give you.&#8221;<br/><br/>Podim rattled the gate. &#8220;I've got a family to defend, and our biggest threat is you. They barely've got enough for a week of food up in the main camp after your little heist. A week. For seven hundred ren. That&#8217;s cruel.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s business,&#8221; Divchena said.<br/><br/>&#8220;I suggest you come out before I drag you out.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;I can't leave my flock to starve, much like you can&#8217;t let yours.&#8221;<br/><br/>Podim lowered his gaze.<br/><br/>No matter that she really was just a shepherd with a moonlit past now, Divchena demanded respect. Even the Senkcha Family, feared by anyone with proper sense, was not exempt from this rule, thousand members or not. The Shepherd bowed to no one.<br/><br/>Podim rolled up his sleeves. &#8220;Well then. I guess I will drag you.&#8221; He hopped the gate.<br/><br/>Before his first footfall hit the loamy soil Divchena had seized her orb, crushed it, and drew from it shards a snarling, vulpine spirit. It charged Podim, fangs bared and jaw snapping. It latched its maw around his ankle, undeterred by his kicks and yelps of pain.<br/><br/>Was it disrespectful to play with one&#8217;s fears when they became violent? Divchena thought not. She raised her crook, veins aglow with her Essence&#8217;s soft orange light, and aimed it above Podim&#8217;s wife.<br/><br/>&#8220;Call it off or I loose it,&#8221; Zelina demanded, voice trembling. She fumbled a rock into her sling&#8217;s pouch.<br/><br/>Divchena shook her head once, slow, methodical, and smug. Posturing did not frighten her. Zelina wouldn&#8217;t loose her sling. The only violence in the young woman&#8217;s past had been done to her, not by her. Such was the life of a pickpocket.<br/><br/>&#8220;I said call it off,&#8221; Zelina said.<br/><br/>Podim shrieked like an infant any time the spirit came near.<br/><br/>Divchena opened her mouth, but instead of shouting back at Zelina she chanted a high-pitched, ghostly call. It ricocheted between the mountain slopes guarding the Valley, three or four echoes reverberating in each syllable before the words faded.<br/><br/>Bells tinkled in the distance.<br/><br/>Wincing, Zelina looked back at the old man, then glanced at Podim, and finally stared at Divchena with helpless eyes. &#8220;Please. Let him go.&#8221;<br/><br/>Again Divchena called a haunting melody, this one brief and steeped in urgency. A host of clinking bells flowed quicker than an avalanche down the mountains, but it was not sheep that ran.<br/><br/>It was family.<br/><br/>Three hundred ren or more charged the Valley, wielding their own slings as well as bows and knives. Some carried armfuls of rocks to chuck. Arrows, stones, and throwing blades hailed down, pelting the Senkcha representatives with the ire of those who launched them.<br/><br/>&#8220;Kvilela&#8217;s sight,&#8221; the old man swore. He tugged the reins fastened to his hillwalker's horns. It reared and bellowed. The ground quaked when it planted its feet back on the dirt.<br/><br/>The spirit, unbalanced by the shivering field, released Podim for a moment; he seized his chance and sprang over the fence, arms shielding his head. He snatched his wife&#8217;s hand and dragged her toward their hillwalkers.<br/><br/>&#8220;I am the Shepherd, and this is my flock,&#8221; Divchena yelled, arms outstretched as if to embrace the sky. &#8220;Tell your matriarch my name. Sow fear and sense into your siblings and children and warn them off hunting my flock!&#8221;<br/><br/>Her family, all the ruffians, street rats, and luckless miscreants who had come to her sheepfold in search of sanctuary and nourishment, the thieves and pickpockets desiring better roads to scavenge, roared along with her.<br/><br/>The Senkcha representatives wheeled their mounts around to meet a wall of Divchena&#8217;s family members quick-footed enough to have made it down the lower slopes in moments rather than whiles.<br/><br/>Divchena tucked a strand of her burgundy hair behind her pointed, downturned ears. The spirit shattered; distorted space wobbled where it once stood until the shards warped back into a tiny orb. With it vanished the light in her veins. She plucked it off the ground and pocketed it.<br/><br/>Slipping between shadows, creeping in the absence of light, taking what did not belong to her: it never failed to enthral her. And when someone caught her? Well, that&#8217;s what family was for, and they always took her side.<br/><br/>&#8220;Strip them, search them, and send them away,&#8221; Divchena said to her flock. Satisfied with the conclusion of their meeting, she wandered off to fetch her lambs from the low meadow by the River Polikni. It was time for them to rest.<br/><br/>
