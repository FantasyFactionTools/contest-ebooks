All just right for our humpadoo bootscootin' Cat Country Mewsic Festival kickin' off today and all through the week here in Fisher, best Cat city of this great little ol' State. Glad the skies are calm as some of our fantastical neighbours are joinin' us from Country Plains. </p><p>Dragon Highlord Vulk Agni is flying across to present Red Hot Prizes for Best Howlin' and Yowlin', Sleekest and Smoothest, Ruffest and Tuffest. He's bringing local MP Wilde Hunter and The Naughty Nymphs &amp; Saucy Satyr Singers, all headin' here to make sweet mewsic at the Festival and to host Mad Midnight Picnics In The Woods afterwards. </p><p>Woooohooo can't wait for splendour in the catnip, tanglin' in the treetops.

Where oh where can she be?</p><p>Major stock holders Pussycat and Hedwig have disappeared together. It is rumoured they went to sea with plenty of money, but no sightings by the Seacat Patrols have been reported. Another source suggests they went to London to visit the Queen, but this is unlikely as she's been isolated since the Catinental Catflap closed. </p><p>Gobblecat King Jareth of White Persia is furious and has hired Mister, a famous Chicatgo catective to search for them, with trainee Wizard Baker. </p><p>We asked Lord of the Skies Gwydir what this would mean for airmail. He was concerned that letter post will become obsolete and all communication controlled through Cattodumpf's nefarious See-mail. The Tortoiseshell Council will confer on preserving quill and ink and report back early next century.</p><p>The Cat Mint assures us that there is sufficient Purr in the Reserve Cupboard to guarantee Mousegages on your homes, do not panic. Further announcements later.</p><p>Holy Litter Catwoman, CNN hinting at some backsider trading there. Should anyone see Hedwig or PussyCat you could dob them in to the authorities. Or not. Depending on how you feel. And what they have to offer. Cats always know which side their paws are buttered, after all. Time for another important message from our sponsors -</p><p><em>Calling all WildCats, do you suffer from Bloodtooth?

Good to be on 100.3FM. As you can imagine life with no tail is a harsh start, so I grew up on the big city streets hangin' with Sundog the Hippypup. Then one night the Dark Barkers caught me and dragged me to a life of hell. Today I'm singing one from the heart, Mirkwood Prison Blues for my friends still languishin' there. </em></p><p>I hear the Nazdogs comin'</p><p>Demons, kept by evil men</p><p>And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when </p><p>I'm stuck in Mirkwood's dungeons and time keeps draggin' on </p><p>But those Nazdogs keep a-comin altho' ol' Sauron's gone.</p><p>When I was just a baby, my mother said to me </p><p>Always be a good King, don't never wear those Rings</p><p>But I wanted to be famous and flashed it, low and high</p><p>Now I hear ol' Sauron laughin' and hang my head and cry.</p><p>I bet there's hobbits feastin' on a fancy homecooked stew</p><p>They're probly drinkin' coffee an' smokin' pipeweed too</p><p>Well I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free</p><p>But those Nazdogs keep a-flyin' and that's what tortures me</p><p>Well if they freed me from this dungeon and loosed me from this mine</p><p>I could die a little gentler, seein' stars that shine</p><p>Far from Mirkwood prison, that's where I want to stay</p><p>A-livin' with the hobbits to sing my blues away.</p><p>Wahey Manx, I'm not an emotional mog but my whiskers are twitchin', that is sad. Relieved you are safely back with us and reminding you listeners Manx will be at the Festival all week, be sure to drop some Tunachews in his bowl if you see him.</p><p>Award winning Mercat author, Celeste Sunk, wrote Princes of Toads, which won the 2015 Yugo Award for Best New Fantasy. Our much loved critic, Mrs Norris of Furry Fantasy Faction is here with a review. Glam grooming to you Mewriel, and glad to hear the retired founder of FFF, Mr Argus Filch is settled in Caretakers Cages Retirement Home.</p><p><em>Luscious lapping to you, Crooksy. This first book of The Spawn Empire series introduces ToadPrinces Jaran and Jog. </em></p><p>In their youth they fall foul of the FrogFather and are cruelly parted. Jaran is banished to ride a camel in the terrible Dry Sherry Desert, far from water and squishy bugs. Tiny Jog is transported by rabid reindeer to State of the Leering Snowman. He trudges through the frozen waste, desperately yearning for his beloved soulmate Jaran. That little spec of green in an unwelcoming, white, white world while Jog struggles to control a humpy horror amid burning sand. </p><p>Oh listeners you will search your souls, as you drag yourself along with each tortuous webfootstep or gasping gulp. This book merited 4 stars for the exquisite anguish I felt for our dear ToadPrinces. If it had included the Ice Giants Saga or the Bedouin Brouhaha I would have given it that one extra star. Maybe in Volume 2. I will not spoil the story, but urge you to read for yourself. Hint – Happy Ending!!!! Only $5.99 at Rowl's Book and Bootlegge Emporium on Prowl Street. </p><p> </p><p>Bringing you our friendly sponsor again</p><p><em>Spray on some Spraay</em></p><p>Spray every day …………………..</p><p/><p>Time to leave Country Cats 100.3 FM. </p><p>But you are all welcome back for a Mad Midnight Picnic…….</p><p> </p><hr/><h3>Original Source</h3>

<p>KSNR (100.3 FM, "100.3 Cat Country") is a radio station broadcasting a country format. Licensed to Fisher, Minnesota, it serves the Grand Forks, North Dakota area. It first began broadcasting in 1983. The station is currently owned by iHeartMedia, Inc..</p>
<p>KSNR also broadcasts University of North Dakota men's and women's basketball home games, while sister station KQHT broadcasts University of North Dakota men's ice hockey and football games as the flagship station, and sister station KKXL-AM broadcasts University of North Dakota women's ice hockey. 100.3 Cat Country competes with Leighton Broadcasting's 97 KYCK.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>The station began life at 99.3 FM as KOSN in Thief River Falls, Minnesota in 1976. KOSN broadcast only 3,000 watts. The station changed call letters to KSNR in 1983 as it flipped to an oldies format, concentrating on 50s and 60s "Golden Oldies" format. After upgrading to 100,000 watts at 100.3 FM in 1987, the station attracted listeners in Grand Forks, North Dakota, since the signal could be heard on most radios and KSNR was the only oldies station in the area.</p>
<p>KSNR later became "Kool 100.3", and began playing 1970s era music, and moved its studios to Grand Forks after being sold. KSNR also played Christmas music from Thanksgiving Day to Christmas Day annually until the format change in 2005. In 2000, Clear Channel Communications bought out KSNR and several other stations, and the format was changed to play 1960s and 1970s era music. It also became the flagship station for University of North Dakota basketball play-by-play broadcasts.</p>
<p>Kool 100.3 switched to country music as "Cat Country" in October, 2005, competing with Leighton Broadcasting's heritage country station, 97 KYCK and classic country station KNOX-FM "Rooster 94.7". In 2006, co-owned classic hits (a mixture of oldies and classic rock formats) station KQHT "96.1 The Fox" began shifting towards to an oldies format.</p>
<p>In 2005, KSNR changed its city of license from Thief River Falls to Fisher, which would allow it to move its transmitter tower closer to Grand Forks in the future.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2012, all local personalities were removed from Cat Country in favor of Bobby Bones Show in the morning and Premium Choice radio personalities in all other dayparts. The previous local morning show was moved to sister station KQHT (96.1 The Fox), which carries an updated classic hits version of the former "Kool 100.3" oldies format. In 2016, Cat Country brought back some local personalities previously heard on the station.</p></div>
