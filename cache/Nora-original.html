A little bell peels in the air somewhere, comes muffled to our ears and makes me smile. It is proof that time still flows, that soon we'll return indoors, where breathing through your nose doesn't trigger a gagging reflex. <br /><br />"Rachar, do you think the weather was a selling point when they decided to build our prison here?" I ask, panting.<br /><br />"Totally. I can see the ad, 'atmosphere of the 6th circle of Hell, hot, humid, and thick as pudding.'"<br /><br />I stare up at the ever shifting pattern of lush and exotic leaves, criss-crossing above our heads in a breeze we can see but never quite feel. Rachar, halfway through his thirty years sentence, jest as he might, is much more acclimatised than I ever wish to become.<br /><br />"Don't you need my help for gathering more ingredients, Ira? I quite enjoy the rush of danger from those errands."<br /><br />"No. No more errands," I say, "I only need one last ingredient, and..." I make a fluttering motion with my hand, mimic myself flying away. Free. "Soon now."<br /><br />This news makes my friend stir and sit up. After three years of secretly brewing this potion, he must have thought me all talk.<br /><br />"What is it, this last ingredient?"<br /><br />I make a face up at him, peering into the eyes smouldering behind his own little jungle of tangled hair. <br /><br />"It's something I'm not sure I can get."<br /><br />"For real? But you've been so keen on escaping this whole time... Well, maybe it's for the best. Considered what they'd do to you if they catch you. I kinda like you, you know. I'd rather not see <em>that</em> done to you. No one gets out of here unless their time is up."<br /><br />I don't know if it's respect or pity I feel surging in me when he speaks like this, him who won't rebel, won't try to escape. Who sits day after day in this green hell of a place, knowing there will be endless tomorrows made of the same infernal heat, the same corrosive dullness, the same absence of freedom. <br />Making it out doesn't even matter. Trying is my only way to remain sane. I can't relate to his defeatism and meek acceptance. Not that it's easy to ever relate to Rachar, who was done in for running the biggest, most lethal cartel of drugs for were-animals Europe had ever seen, and killing, in his werebear form, five of the special-ops werewolves that were sent to arrest him. A sleek piece of remorseless trash, though a decent fellow one-on-one.<br /><br />"Ira, you're growling."<br /><br />"Sorry, mind wandered."<br /><br />Rachar laughs, pats my hair with a hand monstrous enough to crush my skull in a squeeze. "Think of the future. When you finish brewing that potion of yours and pull a Shawshank over the eyes of Erikson and the crew."<br /><br />"Don't go talking so loud, naming names and mentioning potions!" I sit up, unnerved. "The break is almost over."<br /><br />"Ease up Ira, I'd know if anyone were around. I wouldn't let them lock you down with the bloodies either."<br /><br />"Aye, like you could help it if they decided to."<br /><br />Which is not the real problem. To determine the strength of new inmate magi, the prison's surgeons test the glands that secrete magica, always found in the armpits and throat. That test labelled me as a mere C-class magus, hardly a trouble to handle here.<br />In comparison, A-class magi, like blood witches, are near impossible to catch alive. Meaning the handful of them we have in the basement make my werebear-druglord friend look like a philanthropist. They're kept with their hands in wet casts so they can't sharpen spelling tools, their teeth in moulds to keep them from biting themselves bloody. <br />Not enviable.<br />But people like me, with a little known organ tucked away behind the stomach, who can brew potions in their own bodies&#8211;potion being the romantic name for a magical bile&#8211;are extremely rare, and impossible to safely detain. A-class treatment wouldn't cut it. So long as I'm fed, I can always brew something annoying or even lethal to my handlers.<br />S-class, maybe? As in Straight-to-firing-squad-class. <br /><br />"Surely Erikson wouldn't let them take you away. The man is fond of you."<br /><br />"Brewers are thought extinct since the mid 20th century. They'd probably dissect me, Rachar. Officers would not care for my being some guardian's pet prisoner."<br /><br />"Eurk&#8211;well, I won't talk so... What's that last ingredient anyway?" His hand flies up before I can answer. "Speaking of the Devil," he mutters.<br /><br />"Rachar, Ira, you two deaf? Didn't hear the second bell?"<br /><br />The Devil indeed.<br /><br />"Ah, Erikson. We were busy exchanging news, so much has happened since yesterday after all."<br /><br />"You crazies shouldn't even be allowed to meet."<br /><br />"Crazy? Nonsense, I'm a lamb."<br /><br />"And I'm perfectly conscious of my actions."<br /><br />"That just makes you a horrible person, Rachar."<br /><br />Back in the cool bliss of air-con, I nod to him, a discrete salute I mean as an adieu, his looks are worried, but he tips me an invisible hat before turning away. So long, crazy friend. <br />Up the stairs now, and following Erikson. Like every evening, my aisle is a mess of supernatural creatures and their supernatural gaolers, but I only have eyes for mine. <br /><br />Erikson. I watch his blond head, his shoulders shifting under his miraculously crisp white shirt&#8211;what spell does the man use to keep them dry, I still wonder.<br />By habit, I match his steps. Hateful habit, that makes my face relax, almost smile for him when he looks my way. Too long he's been my mindful captor. The man answering my calls, opening my door. The hand feeding me, the hand swiping me little things, when no one watches. He's a decent guy under the rough persona one needs to work in this jail, and I'm neck deep in Stockholm syndrome. <br /><br />Erickson, for three years blind to my careful plotting. I hid it all from him, always playing the nice, reasonable lass, caught up in troubles bigger than her. Not the weirdo woman bargaining favours at every turn to obtain samples of hair, skin, blood, fabrics, spices... Stealing food, making some rot, pre-digesting others for the desired effects. Anything that might contain the ingredients my gut craves to continue its infernal distillation. <br />Behind his broad back I've licked the walls of my cell, scratching my tongue over the lead paint till I nearly poisoned myself. It's an organic, messy trade.<br />For three years I've brewed this concoction. Haltingly, with no known recipe, brought forth by my instinct and my need to escape, disappear, melt through walls&#8211;any will do so long as I get far away. Where Erikson won't be tearing at my mind, brushing my heart with the very fingers that turn the key in the lock of my cage.<br /><br />"Ira, you're growling."<br /><br />"Funny, that's the second time I've been told today." I pace down my little cell and back up to him.<br /><br />"What is making you so tense?" he asks, leaning against the bars to talk with me.<br /><br />Erikson. My last ingredient. <br /><br />"Some internal turmoil over something I need but struggle to obtain."<br /><br />"That's the point of jails."<br /><br />"Aye, but smuggling doesn't usually get a magus in jail."<br /><br />"You were smuggling human flesh!"<br /><br />I shrug, give him a sad grin. "How would I have known? It was spelled."<br /><br />He smiles back at me, a show of dimples. "Save it for the judges. Your appeal won't be delayed forever."<br /><br />Erikson, who believes me when I lie. <br />I step closer, curl my fingers around the cold steel bars. Looking up at him, I whisper, "will you miss me, when I'm gone?"<br /><br />He frowns. <br />Is it hatred, or love, festering in my pounding chest, that makes me flush and quiver as I wait for his answer?<br /><br />"I'd like that; missing you. If it means you're acquitted."<br /><br />The idea of missing him makes my mind trip over itself.<br /><br />"I think I'd miss you too," I surprise myself saying, "but I don't think I'd like that at all."<br /><br />I dive in the grey pools of his eyes, so close, like full moons pulling at the tides of my emotions. Erikson murmurs my name like a warning, but doesn't move. I'm on the tip of my toes and my fingers rubbing against the wondrous white shirt and the warm flesh behind it. <br />His breath smells like mints and beer and magica. His lips are hot, firm but hesitant, like a cliched first kiss. His fingers are trailing my jaws, scorching my skin. <br /><br />In one strong bite his blood comes gushing into my mouth. He cries, rending my heart&#8211;part free woman, part betrayer. I swallow my feelings along with coppery blood. There is a burning sensation in my guts as the last ingredient creates a chain reaction. <br />The world dissipates in clouds of matter around me. Erikson's hands reach out but pass right through me. Through my victorious smile and my farewell nod like through a gentle wind. <br /><br />I'm immaterial. <br /><br />I'm free.
