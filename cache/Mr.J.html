I touched my brother’s face, his cheeks wet. </p><p>I carried the cat out in a little box. His tortoise shell fur still moving with the breeze, bony legs crumpled from squishing him in his final resting place. Limbs cold and stiff. It was like using one of my wooden puppets in the nursery. That made me sadder than I had felt when we found him.</p><p>We had a strange relationship, the cat and me. Estranged.</p><p>It’s not that I don’t like cats, more that the cat never particularly liked humans. Specifically, me. I do not know why. I never gave him cause, insulted him or trod on his tail accidentally.</p><p>It frustrated me I could never ask him. </p><p>Though I tried, once. Just in case he turned to me with his big yellow eyes and pointed whiskers as white as the winter snows and sharp and thin as straw, and sniffed discourteously as if I were a fool for even dare asking the obvious. Or grunt a noncommittal, ‘Well if you even have to ask…’ </p><p>Which was what I read in his face when I asked him, at night when we were alone in my room. He had been sleeping on my bed all day during the balmy summer. </p><p>Now I wish he had given me an answer.</p><p>He did not deserve such a death; alone among the bed of roses and fur damp from the rains. My father stomped around, the black waxed hairs of his moustache dancing across his upper lip like a worm, unable to show his anger. </p><p>He liked the cat more than he would admit, retiring to his study muttering some excuse about an investigation. I could tell his face was wet too.</p><p>No one else had taken it upon themselves to bury the cat, I found him soon after still lying limp on the conservatory table. I tutted and carried him here, to the stream at the very edge of our grounds.</p><p>I knew he liked it here, the cat. I did too. I would come to write, and draw leaves, and bugs if they didn’t run away. Before burying him by the trickling water I tried to shut his mouth, still open a crack and flashing his sharp teeth. </p><p>A few were yellowed now in his middle age, but still young and healthy. The cat had never been sick. The fur around the edge of his mouth looked different, discoloured. I peered as close as I dared and pulled the mouth down, revealing his gums. They were an unhealthy, dark shade of bruised black red. </p><p>After burying him in the soft dirt in his box, piling stones on top to mark his grave and the animals from digging up his bones for a snack, I marched back to our house and was called to supper. </p><p>When I came downstairs and greeted the strangers politely by curtsying, ignoring the far too interested gaze of one of the older men, I felt the mood shift towards a gentleman in a long black coat, smoking a large yellow pipe in a leather armchair. He had pale blonde hair and was younger than I thought. My father motioned to him proudly.</p><p>‘This is Inspector Spicer, Millicent. I telegrammed for his presence immediately.’</p><p>‘What are you here to inspect, Inspector Spicer?’ I said, quite fairly I thought. Though it still ruminated numerous rumblings of chortling from the rest of the adults behind me. I kept my gaze on the man, still puffing idly in my father’s favourite chair, barely paying me any regard.</p><p>‘Your dead pet, my dear. How old are you?’ Spicer said, raising himself from the grip of the leather with a crunch. I was eleven but I refused to answer him. He inhaled the last remnants of his smoke and exhaled it around himself, snorting it back through flaring nostrils.</p><p>‘I am terribly sorry for your loss.’ He said, blankly with a smooth and velvety voice that did not fit his bony and boyish face at all. </p><p>‘I will find out first.’ I said to him. Spicer guffawed, his cheeks puffing like a fish. His cold and pale skin gripped my hand gently. His touch was like a girl’s as he leaned down to me, close enough to kiss. I refused to recoil, my cheeks burning.</p><p>‘Bless you.’ He said, smirking.</p><p>I let go and marched out of the room, a mixture of laughter, confusion, and reprimands from my mother following my exit. </p><p>I knew exactly what happened. The cat was poisoned. It could have been an accident, but I knew him better than that.</p><p>The cat was a smart thing, far more sensible and possessed with more brains than all the stupid girls I was forced to attend school lessons with at the Burkham Plantation. He would never eat something dangerous. </p><p>I passed one of the servants dashing about the corridor, carrying sheets and blankets to the guest room. They were fixing it up for the Inspector, she told me.</p><p>My parent’s room was next door. It was locked as usual, but I’d learned to pick the old metal network inside before. It was easy. The setting sun trickled through the white net curtains, waving at me in the wind as I entered. It was as still and immovable as their room usually was, my parents being very practical and rigid people. But it felt off. </p><p>I checked the window sill, faint muddy paw prints etched against the wooden surface. The cat had snuck in here too then, just like I had. He must have climbed up the tall rose trees, their crooked ashen branches perfect for a cat’s claws.</p><p>I followed the paw prints and turned my gaze to the bedside table, the glass bottle of milk my father liked to drink, to help him sleep. The lid was off, its stopper resting by its side. </p><p>Flecks of milk were still resting on its surface. I picked it up and sniffed the bottle. </p><p>I returned to the dining room in the midst of adult chatter. Inspector Spicer was sat opposite me, munching on some bread idly. He pointed at me with the crust, grinning like he was possessed by a feline creature himself.</p><p>‘I’ve thought about your little proposal, young Millicent, and I will accept your challenge.’ He said with a patronising gusto. I left a pause and nodded firmly, extending my hand again across the steaming pile of food on the table, just above the spiced bird glazed with sticky honey and fat.</p><p>‘I accept. But the loser has to leave the house, forever. And give the other an item of their clothing.’ </p><p>Spicer paused at this, an eyebrow keenly raised. He was interested, his sharp jaw masticating on his bread as hungrily as his green eyes peered at me. My father coughed awkwardly and my mother hissed under her breath at my forwardness. </p><p>‘Very well then.’ The inspector shook my hand. ‘You drive a hard bargain, young Millicent.’ He said, guffawing again with the fellow guests.</p><p> </p><p>I waited for the laughter to die down, and turned to my father.</p><p>‘I have solved the case, papa. The cat was poisoned with One-Eyed Poppy Juice. It’s the same colour as milk. The milk the cat drank from the lid of your bottle by your bedside. The one laced with poison. I gave a drop to the maid to test it. She’s in the bathroom being sick now.’</p><p>A random lady gave a start of horror, a delicate hand to her chest. My father tried to interrupt. I cut him off his stammering.</p><p>‘I presumed you must have given him milk from there before, otherwise he wouldn’t have known to have looked for it.’ I said, watching him snap his mouth shut and nod slightly, sadly. ‘So the Inspector Spicer poisoned your milk, papa. Though I am not sure what he would gain from that.’ I said, unaware of the guests glancing to my mother’s shocked figure at the head of the table. </p><p>‘You telegrammed him but a few hours ago, and yet he arrived even before the message would have been sent. There was a fire in town at the Royal Office, it was reported in the Daily Royal Newspaper. Therefore Inspector Spicer killed our cat.’ </p><p>I picked up my knife and fork and cut into my bird, letting the gravy drip down the utensil. I was famished. The blonde man’s jaw was drooped, aghast and stammering with burning cheeks as my father glared at him, the guests fumbling with themselves awkwardly. I popped a wodge of food in my mouth and chewed happily. It was delicious. </p><p>‘Oh. I would like your coat please Inspector Spicer. It will suit me nicely in the winter’ I said, between mouthfuls. </p><p>‘And don’t ever come back.’</p><p> </p></div>
