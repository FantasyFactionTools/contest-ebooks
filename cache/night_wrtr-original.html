There are few things that get the blood rushing like sneaking about with intent to steal something priceless. For Samuel Thirston, falling through a stained glass window beat it hands down. He gave a pathetic scream as he fell mingled with shards of glass. Cross stealth off Thirston&#8217;s abilities this evening. <br /><br />He tried bracing for impact, spinning too wildly to see what lay directly below him. A pew, perhaps? Maybe the organ, which had a nice array of pointed tubes protruding upward to impale a faller, or more likely, the vast center isle that divided the church sanctuary in half. <br /><br />Of all the possibilities, Thirston landed in a pool of water. <br /><br />He splashed with a thud, taking his breath away and racking his ears like a drum. He gritted his teeth as glass sank into the water, reaching for him with their sharp edges as if the High Father guided their course. He roared a curse but it came out as a gurgle, followed by a choking spasm as the last of the air left his lungs. <br /><br />He burst through the surface coughing and spitting, hauling himself over the side of the shallow pool and crashed onto his back. He stared up at the hole, letting his breath calm. He stood a moment after that, drenched and irritated.<br /><br />Clapping echoed through the church. &#8220;You really are a lucky idiot, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; Thirston whirled about, searching. He knew that accent. <br /><br />&#8220;You should be one to know, Irish,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You granted me that wish yourself.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Ugh,&#8221; Irish said. &#8220;Remind me not of that unfortunate event, Sammy. &#8220;<br /><br />Thirston grunted, scanning the balconies. Irish sounded so close. <em>Keep him talking, flush him out</em>, he thought. &#8220;I liked the idea. Came in handy more than once. A lot you can do with luck.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Obviously.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Where are you, Irish?&#8221; Thirston howled. &#8220;You can&#8217;t hide from me!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not hiding,&#8221; he said with a sigh. &#8220;Seriously, Sammy.&#8221;<br /><br />He continued to look about, but then caught the movement of a hat around the opposite side of the baptism pool. He walked a few paces around it, spotting the short fellow called Irish with an irritated look to his face. <br /> <br />&#8220;Ah,&#8221; Thirston said. &#8220;There you are.&#8221; He cleared his throat. &#8220;Well, I thought we agreed not to cross paths again?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We did,&#8221; he said, raising a hand to stroke his red beard. &#8220;I said <em>I</em> was coming to Boul&#8217;o Charm. You agreed to go to Cupbard.&#8221;<br /><br />Thirston nodded, lips pursed. &#8220;I vaguely remember that conversation. Are you sure <em>you</em> weren&#8217;t supposed to go to Cupbard, and <em>I</em> wasn&#8217;t supposed to come to Boul&#8217;o Charm?&#8221;<br /><br />Irish&#8217;s face burned. &#8220;You heard about the Talking Sword, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;<br /><br />Thirston shrugged. &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Damn the day I showed you my rainbow!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We all make mistakes, you know?&#8221; He pointed to the glass above. &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m in need of some serious coin, Irish. That sword would set me to rights. Got into a little bit of trouble with the Cupbard Latches, if you know what I mean.&#8221;<br /><br />Irish lost the anger in his face and found his laugh once again. &#8220;Oh? Trouble you say?&#8221; He grinned.<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah, I&#8230;&#8221; Thirston narrowed his eyes. &#8220;You told them I was coming didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I vaguely remember that conversation,&#8221; he said, that stupid twinkle shining in his eye. <br /><br />&#8220;Fuck you, Irish.&#8221; Thirston&#8217;s shoes squelched as he walked away toward the back wall of the sanctuary. Irish followed behind him, chuckling softly. Thirston made it to the pastor&#8217;s podium, pushed it over and stared at the hidden door beneath. It was flat and made of solid godsteel, which was unbreakable. Dead center was a massive lock dial with a hundred hash marks. To each side was another dial, but only half the size. <br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;ve already tried, Sammy.&#8221; The leprechaun sat next to him crossed legged with an intense stare. "Been here every night for a week, yet haven&#8217;t come close to getting a single digit.<br /><br />&#8220;Irish, you just need a little luck.&#8221; He reached to the center dial and spun it to the left. When it stopped, he spun it again to the right. He did the same to the smaller dials, and then stood with his hand on the door handle. It lurched open with a sharp tug. <br /><br />Irish fell back in a gasp, rolling to his feet. &#8220;Bless my Charms, Sammy!&#8221;<br /><br />They climbed down a ladder that seemed to go on forever until they reached a small dark room with a single door. Thirston twisted the handle and swung it open.<br /><br />Brilliant light nearly blinded them from inside, illuminating a massive room three or four times larger than the church above it. &#8220;What in the High Father&#8217;s name?&#8221; Thirston let his mouth gape. It was completely empty save for a dark hole in one corner that stood as tall as the walls. At the opposite end sat a small wooden case. They glanced at each other before bursting into a run. <br /><br />&#8220;50/50, Sammy,&#8221; Irish said.<br /><br />&#8220;60/40.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;50/50!&#8221;<br /><br />They reached the wooden case. A hammer appeared from under Irish&#8217;s coat, which he smashed against the lock, breaking it free. Thirston lifted the lid and they stared. It was empty. <br /><br />&#8220;So&#8230;where is it?&#8221; <br /><br />Irish scratched the side of his head.<br /><br />&#8220;You two don&#8217;t look like pastors.&#8221; A women&#8217;s voice behind them! The two spun about. Thirston stood motionless. A thud said Irish had fainted. <br /> <br />In front of him was a mass of flesh and teeth. &#8220;Allow me to introduce the mighty Brutus Tyrannosaurus.&#8221; The massive creature tilted its head after a long silence. &#8220;Hello?&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;High Father,&#8221; Thirston mumbled. &#8220;A talking dinosaur.&#8221;<br /> <br />Soft clanks rang from the ladder. Thirston glanced over, ready to run, when he saw Irish hauling ass up the ladder. &#8220;100/0, Sammy! 100/0!&#8221; Then he was up and out of the room. <em>Fucking leprechauns!</em><br /><br />&#8220;Excuse me?&#8221; Thriston looked back at Brutus. &#8220;Are you a pastor or not?&#8221;<br /><br />He cleared his throat. &#8220;Uh, so...Brutus, is it? Pleased to meet-&#8220;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh dear, forgive me,&#8221; the woman's voice said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not Brutus. My name is Leech. Please, look down.&#8221; So he did, down to the massive claws on Brutus&#8217; feet. &#8220;Up. Up. No, down. The necklace! Look at the necklace!&#8221; Thirston found the massive chain around the dinosaur&#8217;s neck, and dangling from it was a brilliant sword of silver with a ruby hilt. &#8220;Ah, you found me!&#8221;<br /><br />The Talking Sword hung like a pendant from a fucking dinosaur. His luck had finally run out. <br /><br />The dinosaur loomed closer, bringing its head down to stare at Thirston. Its breath nearly knocked him back, filled with a nasty stink of something rotten. &#8220;If you would answer my question, please?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Right,&#8221; Thirston said. &#8220;A pastor you say? No. A thief, actually.&#8221; <br /><br />&#8220;Ah, so you must have come for me?&#8221;<br /><br />Thirston grimaced. &#8220;I apologize, I see you have no intention of being stolen.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Quite the contrary,&#8221; Leech said. &#8220;But, had you been a pastor I would have had Brutus eat you.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Lucky me,&#8221; Thirston said.<br /><br />&#8220;So, shall we go?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I grow tired of Brutus and this enclosure. The pastor used a particular magic to bind my soul to this sword, so I will want to undo that as you can imagine. Can&#8217;t rightly do that stuck down here, now can I? I&#8217;ll make you a deal. I&#8217;ll tell Brutus not to eat you if you vow to help me regain my body these pastors have stolen. Deal?&#8221;<br /><br />Did he really have a choice? &#8220;Deal.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; Brutus came closer to expose his neck, pushing the sword within Thirston&#8217;s reach. &#8220;Go on then.&#8221;<br /><br />Thirston kept a wary eye on Brutus as he slipped the sword free. The blade was made of some kind of crystal, and it was&#8230;warm to his touch. <br /><br /><em>Thank you.</em> The voice was a whisper at the back of his head. Something gripped him and he shuddered. His body flexed backward, but he didn&#8217;t fall. A searing heat surged up his arm to his chest, then settled behind his eyes. <em>Ah.</em> Thirston&#8217;s body relaxed. <em>You&#8217;re a smart fellow. You can&#8217;t imagine how difficult it was to survive in the mind of that thing. It was like trying force a museum into a walnut. You though? Oh, I will like you.</em> Thirston&#8217;s body moved toward the ladder. Thirston panicked, his sobs locked deep in his mind where she had severed his control. <em>Oh, don&#8217;t worry. I will return you to your body soon enough. You freed me from this prison and I will not forget it.</em> She forced a smile on Thirston&#8217;s face. <em>You have a wide range of skills</em>, she said, searching through his memories. <em>Most useful.</em> Thirston climbed the ladder and walked to the sanctuary door. <br /><br />She led him out into the night on the open street where a light rain fell. <em>What a lucky day this turned out to be. </em>
