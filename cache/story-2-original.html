To the church, they said, and I went. Chapel was a heft of stone, stark contrast against the shanties. Docklands were known for many things, but opulence wasn&#8217;t one of them. I had not come for fanciful excursions, nor pleasure, but because of murder. <br/><br/>Twelve bodies lay scorched in the noonday sun south of here. Old Town&#8217;s north side was burned with wonder, a black line of soot running worry. It laid a painful gnaw in my stomach. Woulfe hadn&#8217;t set me to investigate, but I knew this would spread if it wasn&#8217;t nipped early. Digging told a harder story. This wasn&#8217;t some anarchist jig gone awry, but wild rivers of magic. Whether planned or by accident, I had a problem, and a masque had to be it. <br/><br/>Eyewitnesses had sent me here, to a faithful house pining salvation from the clergy. This couldn&#8217;t be it, I had muttered all the way here, but evidence told me otherwise. I had to trust these nobodies. Still. The knife in my coat pocket was the only religion I needed, I noted. That, and the shake in my fingertips, ready. <br/><br/>I coughed.<br/><br/>Wind was picking up off the quay, spray doing nil to help my nerves. Afternoon rain made the cobbles slick, but I didn&#8217;t slip, no sir. I swallowed confidence and swept through the front door. Hinges creaked me a greeting, but I kept on. <br/><br/>Sanctuary was long, longer than it had any right to. Church was one of the oldest in Lebokant, and it showed. Not in the braziers&#8217; brass encrusted, nor the statue of the Almighty and His rising sun. No, it was in the details, places nobody looked, not unless they were looking for them. Where stained glass from my home might show, the eastern nations held stripes and swirls in their glass accents. I thought them curious when I had first arrived, but now? Now they were nothings six years in. Nothing but a reminder that this wasn&#8217;t my turf, not really, not when you thought hard about it. <br/><br/>Garek didn&#8217;t have to think too hard to know this. He was in the back, I guessed, place void of anyone of note but the usual homeless and acolytes dozing on the pews. I stepped past the altar, toward his office and to the right. &#8220;Grayson, is that you?&#8221; His voice was low like a riverbed, smooth, but if anything, he knew I was coming. He was drinking. Bottle was half empty, yeah, yet the night was still young and him a church man through and through. &#8220;I assumed we would chat, eventually. Please, sit.&#8221; <br/><br/>Man motioned to the seat across from him, and I did.<br/><br/>&#8220;You have a good walk?&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;It was something.&#8221; I placed an arm on the table, got comfortable. Yet the twitch in my fingers wouldn&#8217;t quit. &#8220;You hear about the bodies out in Old Town? Those burned to a toast, scarred and left on the streets?&#8221; No sense beating around the bush. A known Black Crown agent didn&#8217;t show up on your doorstep for a friendly get together. I ran business full round the clock.<br/><br/>Garek understood. &#8220;I heard well, I did.&#8221; Man sipped at his wine. Wriggled his nose at the taste, but took another swig. Gulped hard. &#8220;That what bring you here?&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221; Unfortunately. <br/><br/>&#8220;You never come just to visit,&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;Are you here to seek asylum after a long run with the law? Or you think it one of my men, hmm?&#8221; <br/><br/>I could hear the strain in his voice, like a father holding back the switch. &#8220;Neither.&#8221; <br/><br/>The lines under his eyes lost their wrinkles, if just for a moment. <br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;m here looking for the man who did it.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Ah, I see.&#8221; <br/><br/>I had known Garek since my first stint in this backwater land. He had held some exotic paintings from the western city-states, shipped express and him slow to answer questions. But that laconic tongue had held true with a bribe, no sign of the Guard since. Man kept the docks strung together, holy fire behind his priests&#8217; eyes and a fervor of gratitude running the piers. He was a good man, by all accounts. Better than most I had ever met. Provided a warm meal and shelter to any who asked. Never saw him turn away an open palm, and that made me wonder.<br/><br/>Not hesitate, have you. Couldn&#8217;t survive long with a flinch in your satchel, but I stumbled here to this seat. Had questions and maybe he could answer. &#8220;What do you know about the burnings?&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Not much.&#8221; He finished off his glass. &#8220;Not much to talk about, anyway.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure, but humor me.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Alright. Heard they were refugees, people from the West fleeing a famine. People from your neck of the woods, I believe. Though, maybe not that far west.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;I see.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;Sure, plenty of people would want to see them die. Pity they had to.&#8221;<br/><br/>My thoughts lingered on the end. &#8220;Had to?&#8221; <br/><br/>He kept silent. Pushed the glass away, bottle near half empty, and his wits reaching there, too. Even so, man wanted me to pull it out of him. It hurt. <br/><br/>&#8220;That&#8217;s not wine, is it?&#8221;<br/><br/>Man didn&#8217;t say a word. He wiped blood from his lips and eyes rose to meet mine. His stare could cut stone. &#8220;They had to die, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Little Midgets were stirring up too much trouble, yeah?&#8221; <br/><br/>The old man ran a hand through his salt and pepper hair. Tucked one behind his ear. &#8220;Yeah. Yeah, they did.&#8221;<br/><br/>There was a myriad of reasons why Garek would torch the immigrants, and a number more why anybody else would want to see them dead. But a clergy man, out in broad daylight, that&#8217;s not what made my heart tremble. &#8220;Don&#8217;t much care for the details, you understand. No, all I care about is how long you&#8217;ve been hiding the gift.&#8221; <br/><br/>His gray eyes softened for a second, and a second of sympathy was enough from the Almighty. He hadn&#8217;t expected me to piece the puzzle together, and sure as hell not that quickly. Make me think it was a ritual or improvised baptism by fire, not magic. Yeah, sure. Steel in my pocket itched something wicked. This was where things got sticky. <br/><br/>He could&#8217;ve torched me there, locked in his home without a lie needed to tell anybody. <br/><br/>But Garek didn&#8217;t burn those people because they were rustling up some protests or change. His vision fell to the floorboards. &#8220;You lost control, I know.&#8221; That was the only explanation. Dabble in the dark arts and soon your vision will be swimming black. Many didn&#8217;t make it back, and the man sitting here was a miracle if I ever seen it. &#8220;That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re drinking. You think there&#8217;s only a bit of sanity left, and I agree. You need to cling to it, like it&#8217;s your dying breath, and it is.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;I know.&#8221; He paused, collected his thoughts, and continued. &#8220;It started just to save coal, to make life easier for the church folks. Then it became a way to help the poor have a warm winter, provide food and a reason. Gave us protection and rooted out thugs, it did. But then&#8230;&#8221; His words trailed off, as they are wont to do. <br/><br/>That&#8217;s how all descents begin, with a start and a first step. That&#8217;s all it takes. <br/><br/>I sighed and rose. Pulled the knife from my frock and placed it on the table next to his glass. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a choice to make.&#8221; Knew to the heavens I couldn&#8217;t make it, but it needed to be done. &#8220;Think hard about it, understand. I don&#8217;t want to make another visit.&#8221; Never wanted to come here in the first place. Never wanted to come this close to the docks ever again.<br/><br/>Garek grabbed my arm before I could run. &#8220;Do me a favor,&#8221; those cold eyes shone in the firelight. I froze. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ever let it overtake you, okay. Do that for me.&#8221; The bite was gone from his gaze, replaced by something scared and wrong.<br/><br/>How could you argue with a dead man? &#8220;I won&#8217;t.&#8221;<br/><br/>Whether that was a lie or a promise, that was not mine to say. I rolled my feet away from his office, out the hallway and into the pews. His words lingered in my footsteps, a hesitance in each step. I stopped at the altar, pulled a crown from my wallet and shoved it into the tithe box. It wasn&#8217;t enough, never was, but it&#8217;d have to do.<br/> <br/>I repeated that to myself, again. It&#8217;d be a long walk back without it.<br/><br/><br/>
