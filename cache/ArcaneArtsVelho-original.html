He twirled the piece between his bluish fingers, looking intently at the board, before putting it back down to its previous spot. He scratched his scruffy beard and pulled the collar of his coat higher. &#8220;Although I have enjoyed our games during these last two days, I haven&#8217;t spoken much in a fear of fraternizing, but&#8230;&#8221; he said hesitantly to his opponent. &#8220;I have to ask, what gambit is this?&#8221;<br /><br />The man on the opposite side of the chessboard shrugged. &#8220;I have no idea what it&#8217;s called&#8221;, he said and let out a short, amused breath that twirled across the dim room. &#8220;I&#8217;m not really an expert at chess; my son is. But I&#8217;ve played enough with him to pick up on a few strategies. Nevertheless, if it has a name, I don&#8217;t know it.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Well, maybe the winner of this game should come up with a name for it. Would that bet sound good to you, captain?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I not a betting man, but I&#8217;ll amuse you since you are the only one willing to play with me.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I think captain Benko means that you are the only one who plays well enough to have a chance against him,&#8221; said a third man who had been sitting on the other side of the room, trying to pretend not to care about the game. Now, however, his curiosity got the better of him and he strode to the others.<br /><br />&#8220;Yes, colonel, that is what I mean. But I would never say it.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Well, perhaps it&#8217;s time for me to learn this game.&#8221; The colonel clasped his hands behind his back and leaned over the board. &#8220;So, what is <em>a</em> gambit?&#8221;<br /><br />The first man chuckled from beneath his woollen collar. He seemed less tense now. &#8220;I&#8217;ll explain it, colonel. A gambit is like a diversion. It&#8217;s a series of first moves where you take a piece, usually a pawn, and&#8212;&#8220;<br /><br />The door of the room slung open, cutting off the explanation. An icy breeze along with a hunched soldier rushed in from a trench outside the door, distant shell impacts and a muffled banging of a machine-gun accompanying their entry. The soldier closed the door and caught his breath. &#8220;Colonel J&#225;ny, captain Benko,&#8221; he said, saluting the officers.<br /><br />&#8220;Yes private?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Colonel, sir, they need you in the command bunker. Both of you.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What&#8217;s happening?&#8221; captain Benko asked, getting up.<br /><br />&#8220;Well...&#8221; the private started but then nodded towards the man sitting by the chessboard. The captain and the colonel moved closer to the private who continued in a whisper, &#8220;The Soviets are making a push.&#8221;<br /><br />The colonel nodded, and the captain moved immediately to the door, opening it to his superior. &#8220;Private, you stay and watch him,&#8221; he instructed.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to run,&#8221; the man at the table said and pulled up his coat, showing the shackles on his ankles and gently jingling them with his foot.<br /><br />Captain Benko gave a brief smile. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not afraid of that. I&#8217;m afraid that you cheat.&#8221; With that he stepped through the door but then stopped. &#8220;Oh what the hell,&#8221; he said and came back. He set his king on its side. &#8220;You name the gambit and then tell me the next time we play. In the mean time, you could teach the private here how to play.&#8221; Then he hurried after the colonel, leaving the private and his teacher.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The mood among the commanders of the Hungarian Second Army was grim as the communications officer told the news. &#8220;We have reports telling that the Soviets have started an offensive against the Romanian Third Army on the northern side of Stalingrad.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;On our side,&#8221; colonel J&#225;ny muttered, nodding. He cleared his throat. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll hear similar news from the Romanian Fourth Army on the south side. The Soviets are most likely going to try and pincer their way through the thinned lines of the Romanians in order to cut off the Germans in the city.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Colonel, if the Soviet Fifth Tank Army and the 21st Army with its tank and motorized brigades are both involved on the northern assault, we are talking about hundreds of tanks and other armoured vehicles; the Romanians can&#8217;t stop that many. Nor can we or the Italians,&#8221; captain Benko said and shook his head. &#8220;As you said, we are all too thin. And we don&#8217;t have enough of anti-tank weapons to deal with a full-blown tank offensive head on.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You are right, captain Benko, the situation is not good.&#8221; The colonel checked the most recent radio transcripts and then a map showing the latest troop movements. &#8220;We knew this was coming; for the last few days, the Romanians have been telling they are hearing sounds of tanks assembling. They have asked for reinforcements and supplies but so far received none.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;But are the reinforcements coming?&#8221; the captain asked.<br /><br />&#8220;According to the Germans, yes, but there&#8217;s no accurate information as to when.&#8221; The colonel took a deep breath and ran his eyes over the officers gathered in the room. &#8220;Any suggestions, gentlemen?&#8221;<br /><br />Had it not been for the faint sounds of war coming from outside, the next few moments would have passed in complete silence. After a while, captain Benko stepped up. &#8220;Well, if the reinforcements truly are coming, then I&#8217;d say we need to buy some time for the Romanians. If the Soviets really are conducting a double envelopment manoeuvre, they are going to concentrate their forces against the defenders nearer to the city. So we, further north, could make a move of our own with relatively little resistance.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Are you saying we should attack? Abandon our defensive positions, however poor they may be?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No, sir. I&#8217;m saying that we could create a diversion.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;A diversion? Like that gambit of yours?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;More or less. My company&#8212;which is understrength as it is&#8212;could go over the Don River and sneak or punch through all the way to the Volga. There we could make our presence known and possibly force the Soviets to slow down their pincer. Hell, in the best case they could turn most of their attack force towards us if they estimate our size wrong. That&#8217;s unlikely to happen, but if it did, you could coordinate defences better with the Romanians to hold until the reinforcements show up, or even launch a counter-attack to the Soviet&#8217;s flank.&#8221;<br /><br />The colonel looked through the others in the room, for a second opinion, but was met only by shrugs. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s our plan then. Go make ready.&#8221; Everybody saluted the colonel and sprung into action. Before captain Benko could leave, the colonel walked to him. &#8220;What happens to the pawn in the gambit?&#8221;<br /><br />The captain gave a faint smile. &#8220;By definition, a gambit means sacrificing a piece in order to gain an advantageous position.&#8221;<br /><br />The colonel nodded and shook the captain&#8217;s hand. Then captain Benko left the bunker.<br /><br /><br /><div align="center">*****<br /></div><br /><br />Thirty two years later:<br /><br />&#8220;...and that&#8217;s the main difference between the Benko gambit and mister Argunov&#8217;s Volga gambit. If you want to know more, you should buy this book,&#8221; P&#225;l Benko said, smiling. The crowd applauded, but then P&#225;l grew serious. &#8220;As to the gambit&#8217;s name&#8230; I didn&#8217;t name it after myself; I&#8217;m not that vain.&#8221; The crowd chuckled. &#8220;No, it&#8217;s named after my father who passed in the Second World War. He was very supporting and always willing to play a round of chess with me; even after he was pretty sure he&#8217;d lose. I dedicate this book and the gambit to my father&#8217;s memory. Thank you.&#8221;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />After the event, when the spectators had gone and P&#225;l was ready to leave, he saw and old man sitting by a chessboard reserved for an earlier exhibition game. He moved closer to the man and saw a face that was familiar to him from old Soviet chess magazines. &#8220;Mister Argunov?&#8221;<br /><br />The sitting man motioned P&#225;l to take a seat on the other side of the table. &#8220;I came to set one thing straight; the Volga gambit was in fact also dedicated to your father.&#8221;<br /><br />P&#225;l sat down looking puzzled. &#8220;How so?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;During the war, I was held captive by the Hungarian Second Army, and your father showed me compassion by letting me play chess with him. I was the last person to ever play with him. And when I later found out that he had passed during a push to the Volga river, I named the gambit he had used in our last game accordingly. I could tell you more if you would entertain an old man with a friendly game of chess.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Of course!&#8221;<br /><br />Argunov smiled as he picked up a white pawn. &#8220;I think we both know how this goes.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;At least until b5.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Indeed.&#8221;<br /><br /><br />Pawn d4.<br /><br />Knight f6.<br /><br />Pawn c4.<br /><br />Pawn c5.<br /><br />Pawn d5.<br /><br />Pawn b5.<br /><br /><br />
