<br /><div align="center"><strong>The Right Way</strong><br /></div><br />It was pitch black. The musty air hung motionless and carried only the sounds of few underground critters scurrying across the sandy ground. Then came the screams, growing ever louder until ceasing with three distinct thumps... and some cursing.<br /><br />&#8220;Squire! My eyes are acting up. Fix them.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; a monotone voice answered, and soon after a torch was lit. &#8220;Better, sir?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No! I&#8217;m appalled by your incompetence, squire.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;It would help if you opened your eyes, sir.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;My god, that did it. I knew I could count on you.&#8221; The man got up off his squire and looked at the hole in the cavern ceiling. &#8220;See, I told you two the fall wouldn&#8217;t be that bad.&#8221;<br /><br />Third person, a female in heavy leather armour with her face buried in the sand, let out a muffled curse from under the squire.<br /><br />&#8220;Lizael might disagree, sir,&#8221; the squire said as he helped the warrior woman up. &#8220;Are you all right, Lizael?&#8221;<br /><br />The woman growled while the squire gently cleaned her face and ringlets from the dust. &#8220;I&#8217;m fine, Eidan,&#8221; she said through gritted teeth, scowling at their master.<br /><br />But the man didn&#8217;t see it. &#8220;Ha! I knew it! This cave is in fact a dungeon,&#8221; he said, looking at a few decayed cell-like structures near one wall. He put his fists to his hips and raised his chin. &#8220;I, prince Skip of Mercessexumbria, claim this cave-dungeon&#8230; cavungeon&#8230; this dungeon-cave&#8230; du&#8230; da&#8230; dave! For my father the King.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Technically this is a cavern, sir,&#8221; Eidan said.<br /><br />&#8220;And technically you are my squire, squire,&#8221; Skip said and flashed a wide smile. His &#8216;joke&#8217; was lost on Eidan and Lizael but someone clearly found it funny; there was a suppressed laugh coming from somewhere close. &#8220;Lizzy, swallow your food before laughing.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s coming from your sheath, sir,&#8221; Eidan said.<br /><br />&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Skip said and drew his sword. &#8220;Claymr! What is it, my trusty steed?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh notin&#8217;, ser. I just found yer joke funny,&#8221; the sword said with a thick, rhotic accent. &#8220;An&#8217; I think that ye mean a sword, ser.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yes, a trusty sordser.&#8221; Skip turned to Eidan and whispered, &#8220;It&#8217;s not the right word, but he&#8217;s a bit simple.&#8221; Eidan sighed and Lizael took off. &#8220;You&#8217;re right Lizzy; we have dallied enough. Onwards!&#8221;<br /><br /><br /><br />After only a few minutes, someone shouted, &#8220;Help! Over here!&#8221;<br /><br />Lizael and Eidan stopped upon hearing the voice, but Skip strutted towards it with Claymr in hand. &#8220;Ahem, this is prince Skip, the heir to the throne of Mercessexumbria. Show yourself!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m here. On the ground.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What? Under this map I&#8217;m standing on?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I am the map!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;A talkin&#8217; map?&#8221; Claymr exlaimed. &#8220;That&#8217;s the stupidest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Agreed,&#8221; Skip said, picking up the map. &#8220;And yet now I&#8217;m holding one. So tell me, mister Map, what help do you need and why are you looking for it here?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Well, I want to get out of here, obviously,&#8221; the map said. &#8220;I was&#8230; erm&#8230; charting this cavern with&#8212;&#8220;<br /><br />&#8220;Dave!&#8221; Skip interjected.<br /><br />&#8220;No, not Dave.&#8221; The map sounded confused. &#8220;I was with the guy sitting in the corner.&#8221;<br /><br />Skip looked over the map and saw a cob-webbed skeleton. &#8220;My god! I think that man is dead!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeees, he is. That&#8217;s why I need your help.&#8221; As Skip only kept nodding with a blank expression on his face the map continued. &#8220;Why are you here?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We are here to help you. How fortunate!&#8221; Skip said.<br /><br />&#8220;You are?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yes! Though that wasn&#8217;t the original reason. You see...&#8221; Skip trailed off, looking bored. &#8220;Squire, tell him! I have more important things to do.&#8221;<br /><br />Eidan sighed and began his slow narration. &#8220;We are tracking a group of bandits led by an evil witch. If we can&#8217;t stop them, they will decimate a jungle tribe that is technologically advanced&#8212;&#8220;<br /><br />&#8220;And loaded with gold!&#8221; Skip interrupted.<br /><br />&#8220;...but pacifistic.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We were going to go over the mountains rather than under them, but <em>someone</em> wasn&#8217;t willing to pay for the climbing equipment,&#8221; Lizael said.<br /><br />&#8220;Can you believe that old man? Asking for two loafs of bread for a few pieces of rope? Starving my ass; more like greedy.&#8221; Skip shook his head in disgust.<br /><br />&#8220;But that&#8217;s basically how we ended up down here,&#8221; Eidan said. &#8220;By the way, mister&#8230; map. Have you seen the bandits or the witch coming through here?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Well, now that you mentioned it, I did hear a group of people walking about. But I didn&#8217;t like the sound of their boots, so I just sat still. It&#8217;s been quite a while now since they were here though.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We might already be too late.&#8221; Eidan stared into the distance. &#8220;By the time we get there the tribesmen&#8212;children, women and men alike&#8212;might be dead. Their homes burned and belongings pillaged. Their tormented souls crying; all their songs of lamentations will fall to deaf ears.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;My god you are negative, squire,&#8221; Skip said. &#8220;And besides, if we are there, then their songs won&#8217;t fall to deaf ears. They will fall to our ears.&#8221; He looked at Eidan with a smug smile on his face. &#8220;In any case, we should move. Map, show the way!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Erm, okay. Turn a little to the left. No no, my left. And a little more. There!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;But that&#8217;s where we came from,&#8221; Lizael said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going the other way.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Lizzy, Lizzy, Lizzy...&#8221; Skip paused. &#8220;What was I saying?&#8221;<br /><br />Eidan sighed. &#8220;I believe you were going to ignore Lizael&#8217;s sound advice in a demeaning manner.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Of course. Lizzy, Lizzy, Lizzy. You should always follow the map with the man&#8230; rather than a <em>woman</em> with no map&#8230; or man, for that matter.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Aargh!&#8221; was the only thing Lizael said. She sat next to the skeleton when the others left.<br /><br /><br /><br />About an hour went by as the prince and his entourage walked to where they had started and then back to where Lizael had been waiting. And after that it took two hours before they finally found their quarry.<br /><br />&#8220;Piggy! Is this some sort of trap?&#8221; Skip shouted as he saw the evil witch and two of her bandit lackeys.<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s Pigrin!&#8221; the witch muttered under her breath. &#8220;Skip, you know me better; I would never trick you. Have some cake.&#8221; She pointed at a pedestal with a piece of ominously glowing sponge cake.<br /><br />&#8220;The cake is a lie!&#8221; Eidan said, stepping forward and drawing his mace. &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat it!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Wuh?&#8221; Skip asked, mouth full of cake.<br /><br />Pigrin cackled. &#8220;Now you&#8217;re cursed, fool! As long as I live, you will suffer from horrible pains of the stomach.&#8221;<br /><br />There was a swoosh and a thud as Lizael, who had sneaked behind the witch, cleaved Pigrin&#8217;s head right off with her axe. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have time for this,&#8221; she said and then quickly disposed the two bandits. &#8220;This way. I can hear something.&#8221;<br /><br />The men&#8230; and the sword and the map were flabbergasted by this sudden act of brutality and had no intention of objecting to what the woman said. They went after her and could soon hear distant barking.<br /><br />&#8220;You were right, Lizzy. I can hear a cow,&#8221; Skip said and looked at Lizael with uncommon appreciation.<br /><br />&#8220;No, ser. A cuu says muu,&#8221; Claymr said.<br /><br />&#8220;What?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;A cuu says muu. That&#8217;s a dug. A dug says ruf.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;A duck?&#8221; Skip sheathed Claymr and turned to Eidan. &#8220;See? He&#8217;s quite simple.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Look! Daylight,&#8221; Lizael shouted.<br /><br />They all rushed out of the dave, and Skip struck his pose. &#8220;I led us out! Now we must make haste and save the jungle tribe. Map, direction!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Okay, the tribe&#8217;s village is to the east, so&#8230; you need to turn left again. My left.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Again, that&#8217;s not right,&#8221; Lizael said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the opposite of right. You can even see the village from here.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Lizzy, Lizzy, Lizzy, what did I say about the map with the ma&#8212;&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Shut up, Skip!&#8221; Lizael snapped. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to save the damn village by myself then. Or are you coming, Eidan?&#8221;<br /><br />The squire hesitated. &#8220;I <em>am</em> bound to serve him.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll share my tent with you.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I might as well come. It&#8217;s not like I have a contract or anything,&#8221; Eidan said and went after Lizael.<br /><br />&#8220;Traitors,&#8221; Skip growled. &#8220;It&#8217;s just you and me then, Map.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Amd mm, srrr.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;And Claymr,&#8221; Skip said. &#8220;Lead the way, Map!&#8221;<br /><br /><br /><br />A few hours later Skip sat down beside a starting fire and pulled out Claymr. &#8220;It&#8217;s just you and me now.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What happened to the map, ser?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;As the sun was setting down, I realised something: First, that we were heading towards the sunset even though the village was to the east, and then, that I needed some kindling to start the fire.&#8221; Skip took a stick and poked a piece a burning paper deeper beneath the flames.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Claymr said. &#8220;To be fair, ser, as far as I understand, we&#8217;ll git there eventually even if we keep headin&#8217; west.&#8221;<br /><br />Skip smiled. &#8220;I like the way you think, my trusty sordser.&#8221;<br /><br /><br />
