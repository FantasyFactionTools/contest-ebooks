Harbour of Tears is a studio concept album by English progressive rock band Camel. It tells the story of an Irish family who are painfully separated as their young ones depart to the United States to seek a better future. Released in 1996, it was their twelfth studio album.

#### Title and lyrics
Band vocalist and guitarist Andrew Latimer learned that the last sight of Ireland his grandmother's family would have seen was CÃ³bh Harbour, a deep water port that witnessed the fracturing of thousands of families as their sons and daughters departed towards America. Thus the album was titled as the common alias of the port, 'Harbour of Tears'.
