# Footnotes

The bits of text in this section are appended to the bottom of the stories when the book is compiled.  Everything needs to be named correctly for them to show up.

1. Create a directory sharing the same "slugified" name as the contest
1. Create a Markdown file for each author for whom you'd like to append information to their story

NOTE: If you add them _AFTER_ you build the local story cache (the first time you run the compilation script) you will have to pull down all the stories again.  Meaning, it adds the footnote to the end when it downloads the stories, not when it compiles the stories into a book.
